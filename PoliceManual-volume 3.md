**Personnel Management :Concepts & Police Contexts** 

**Introduction** 

1. Personnel  management  concerns  with  obtaining,  organizing,  utilising  and motivating the human resources required by an organization. It develops requisite organization  climate  and  management  styles  to  promote  effective  effort  of  co- operation and trust among all employees. This also helps the organisation to meet its legal obligations and social responsibilities. To sum up, the personnel management aims at getting effective results by organizing and directing the co-operative efforts of human beings.

**The Purpose** 

3. As a result of various activities of the personal management : 
1) the organization develops and maintains its effective.  
1) the organization obtains, develops and retains the quantity and quality of staff for its present and future needs; 
1) the  best  use  is  made  of  staff  and  the  maximum  degree  of  effective  effort  is obtained from them; 
1) constructive and harmonious relationships are established and maintained with the staff which will encourage the highest degree of cooperation from them; 
1) staff are provided with the maximum scope to use their capacities to the full and to develop within the organisation; 
1) equal  opportunities  are  provided  to  potential  or  existing  employees  for employment or promotion; 
1) conditions  of  employment,  employee  benefits  and  working  conditions  are established which will help to achieve the objectives set out above and will also mean that the organization meets its social and legal responsibilities towards its employees. 

**Role of the Personnel Management** 

4. Main  role  of  the  personnel  management  is  to  provide  advice,  services  and functional guidance which will enable management to deal effectively with all matters concerning the employment of people and the relationships between the management of  the organization,  the  people  and the employees. Its overall  aim  is to  make  an effective contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the organization and to the fulfillment of its social and legal responsibilities. The particular aim is to ensure that the personnel objectives of the organization are achieved and the performance of the personnel functions is judged on the extent to which these objectives are met. Personnel function is a very critical   sub-system   of enterprise management. Through   planned   acquisition, organization   and   motivation   of   human resources   it   assists   the management   in   efficiently   achieving   organisational goals   and objectives.  It    provides   a systematic   opportunity   to the organization in critically assessing and   optimizing human contribution towards   organizational effectiveness.   

   **Effectiveness Parameters** 

5. Effectiveness    of  Personnel  Department    depends    upon  the  following  five   factors.      
1) Support   of top   management;       
1) Organic   linkages   with   other sub-systems of the   organization;    
1) Quality   of   co-operation from   line managers;       
1) attitudes   and   insights of   departmental functionaries,   and   
1) Formulation and effective implementation of policies,   systems   and   procedures. 

**The Role Profile** 

6. Personnel  Departments  as  a  repository  of  data  on  the  profile,  roles    and   contributions   of   human   resources   not   only   acquire pre-eminent   position in organizational    hierarchy,    but    plays  a  significant    role    in    achieving organisational excellence. Ideally   speaking the Personnel Department   should play the following   roles:  
1) Advise top management in selecting strategies and approaches that will optimize the contribution of human resource; 
1) Formulate   long   and short   range personnel policies, systems   and   procedures; 
1) Guide   and   assist line managers in   effective implementation   of policies   end   programmes; 
1) Serve as an effective link between management and employees; 
1) Improve the quality   of information   sharing through two-way   communications; 
1) Create  an  enabling  and  facilitative  climate  to  optimize  employee  cooperation, motivation, efficiency, discipline, growth and welfare. 
1) The personnel department advises on personnel policies, strategies, procedures and methods and on the approach that should be adopted to deal with personnel, and professional relations and the problem thereof.  
1) The personnel function has to carry out research and keep in touch with current developments  in  legislation,  social  thought,  the  behavioural  sciences  and  the views of the stake holder.  
1) It must normally be aware of what is happening in the outside world, but it must be equally  capable  of  relating  environmental  changes  to  the  situation  within  the organization.  
1) The  personnel  function  has  to  keep  closely  in  touch  with  trends  within  the organization measuring its employees' level of morale, motivation, commitment and general satisfaction with the organization as employers.  
1) The functional guidance role of the personnel department is to interpret and help to communicate personnel policies and procedures approved by top management, and, on behalf of top management, to provide guidance to managers which will ensure that the policies and procedures are implemented and maintained. 

**Police Personnel Contexts** 

7. Formulation  of  personnel  policies  for  police  should  depend  on  the  following specifics contexts of police functional environs.  
1. Unity of command, centralized authority, rigid hierarchical structure, one way  communication,  impersonality,  unquestioned  compliance  of  orders and instructions are some of the significant features of police organization. 

   Police, however, in a democratic set up can neither adopt the ways and 

   means of Defence Forces nor have the resources, institutional machinery and infrastructure of the civil organizations. 

2. In the absence of institutionalized systems and procedures and because of heavy pre-occupations with operational duties and management of civil crises from time to time, the staff matters do not receive adequate time and attention they deserve and eventually get pushed into the background. The existing personnel policies in the police are generally antiquated, adhoc and sketchy and do not do justice to the current and emerging needs of police personnel. 
2. Any one familiar with the working of the police system in the country will readily concede that personnel management in police organization lacks long-range  planning,  scientific  exactitude  and  necessary  infrastructure. The situation looks much grimmer, when comparisons are made between the police and other premier organization. 
2. We can not run away from the reality that any neglect, adhocism and non- institutionalized  approach  towards  the  legitimate  aspirations  and expectations of the police personnel for a better quality of life will have very grave implications for employee morale, efficiency and the credibility of the force. 

**Rationale for Personnel Department in Police** 

1. While,  work  and  social  pressure  on  the  police  personnel,  since, independence,  have  registered  a  quantum  jump  in  quantitative  and qualitative  terms  due  to  growth  in  population,  mass  education,  socio- economic  legislations,  industrialization  and  planned  economic development  etc.,  the  size  of  the  Force,  infrastructural  facilities  and management systems and procedures have lagged behind. Police officers and staff have to therefore discharge their duties under severe stress and proverbial constraints of human and financial resources. 
2. Any further neglect of the needs and aspirations of the personnel is bound to have adverse impact on the morale of individual staff and officers and the  effectiveness  and  credibility  of  the  whole  police  system.  Police administrators  should  initiate  certain  policy  measures  to  cope  with  the present  situation  and  take  pro-active  steps  to  qualitatively  improve  the working life of the police personnel. 

**The Mechanism** 

8. Personnel Management Concepts in the police departments are in a vascular focus. Scientific, systematic and broad based concepts and polices couldn't be developed due to various reasons. This is high time that well developed mechanisms to look after various aspects of personnel management are developed and adopted in the police organisations. Following are some of the prerequisites in their contact 
1) **Set  up  Personnel  Responsibilities  Centers  :**  Responsibility  Centers  for perspective  planning,  monitoring,  evaluation,  anticipation  and  coping  with  man- management problems, issues and challenges should be created in each State and Central Police Organisations at relevant levels, i.e. State Headquarters, Zone, Range and  District.  This  should  serve  as  a  nerve  centre  for  feeling  the  pulse  of  police personnel  at  all  levels  and  initiate  appropriate  remedial  actions.  The  Personnel Department in the Police Force should be manned by police officers themselves and should be headed by an officer of the rank of Add DGP/Inspector General of Police who should be assisted by appropriate staff and suitable rank of officers at other levels.
1) **Modification & Updating of the Rules & Procedures :** The antiquated rules and regulations should be updated and modified to reflect contemporary conditions and circumstances.  Man-management  manuals  should  be  codified  expeditiously  and circulated to all concerned for guidance and effective implementation of personnel policies and programmes.
3) **Manpower Assessment :** Manpower strength of the Personnel Department at various levels should be worked out on the basis of an exhaustive study of the current and likely work-flow and the size of the force at each location.
3) **Structure & Other Parameters :** While designing the structure of the Personnel Department sufficient care should be taken of the principles of organizational design e.g. unity of command, span of control, decentralization, delegation of powers, role clarity, interdepartmental co-ordination, cultural ethos of the police force etc.
3) **The Sub- Systems :** Personnel Department should have the following sub-systems at the apex level.
1. **Personnel  Administration  :**  Recruitment,  induction,  placement,  transfer, promotion, salary administration etc. 
1. **Staff Relations :** Grievances, Discipline, Communication, Public Relations, Staff Relations, Legal Matters etc. 
1. **Planning  and  Development  :**  Man-power  planning,  Career  Planning, Appraisal  of  Performance,  Personnel  records,  Manuals,  Research  and Publications and Training. 
1. **Welfare  and  Services  :**  Premises,  Housing,  Education,  Sports,  Medical, Provident Fund and Superannuation benefits, Consumer Co-operatives. 
6) **Set up Apex Committee :** For effective planning and co-ordination of policies and programmes it is desirable to constitute an Apex Committee on Human Resource Management. All officers heading the sub-systems should be the members of this committee.  The  Committee  should  meet  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  to  plan, coordinate the activities of each sub-system and to allocate resources required in a scientific and equatable manner. A mid-term review   of the   progress   made   should be under taken,   and corrective actions initiated   in areas   where progress   has   not   been upto the mark. 
6) **Job Description & Job Analysis :** To facilitate efficient discharge of duties by each role incumbent very comprehensive job descriptions and job analysis methods should he evolved. For this purpose the Police Department may appoint   a "Task   Force"   for time bound completion of the task.  If required they may   seek   external professional expertise. 

   **(viii) Specialization Contexts :** The   functionaries   in the   Personnel   Department   should clearly   understand that their role is   basically of a   "Staff Specialist".  Their effectiveness   would therefore lie in the   quality   of guidance   and support   they can give   to   the operating   (line)   functionaries. The  Head  of the   Organization should therefore  make   all  efforts  to   reinforce  the  complimentary  and supplementary  features of the   line   and staff  functions. 

   **(ix) Specialized Training :** Personnel officers should be given specialized training in scientific   management   to optimize their performance. The Central and State level training institutions should, therefore,   arrange   crash programmes   in   personnel   management for various   levels   of   functionaries.      

9. **Perspectives on Police Personnel Management** 
1. In a service organization like the Police, proper utilization of the human resource is the most important prerequisite for achieving the objectives. The  need  for  the  formulation  of  uniform  and  purposeful  policies  of selection,  training, career  planning, etc., has  been recognized,  but little attention has been paid to the planned growth, development and better utilization of the police personnel, which constitute the  most important resource of the department. Neglect of this vital aspect has been mainly due to the fact that personnel management has been left-in the hands of individual unit commanders, who are unable to spare either the time or the attention that is required; nor is there any effective agency at the State police level to look after this significance aspect of police working.  
1. Great  volume  of  work  relating  to  recruitment,  training,  placement, promotion, transfer, welfare, retirement, etc., of large bodies of policemen continues to be attended to by small staff units working under Deputy Inspector-General of Police or an Assistant Inspector-General of Police with the help of a few clerical staff in the State headquarters and by the Superintendents of Police/Commandants at the District/Battalion levels. 
3. Recruitment   procedures    and   stipulated   qualifications   are   not reviewed at regular intervals. If the right types of persons are to be selected in order to make the force a more useful service organization, the task of selection to various posts needs to be entrusted to a specialised agency within the force. 
3. Training of the selected personnel is of vital importance. There is great need  for  change  in  the  attitude  and  outlook  of  the  policemen  towards society,  and  for  the  development  of  new  methods  and  techniques  in dealing with police problems. There is also a need to reorient and remodel training syllabi and methods. In-service   training,   which is the   very basis for higher level of performance, is conspicuous by its absence in many States. 
3. Career  management  suffers  a  great  deal  in  the  police  forces  due  to inadequacy  of  personnel  policy.  Identification  of  merit  and  finding  the right  person  for  the  right  job,  is  not  being  attended  to  properly  in  the present  system  of  haphazard  selection  and  unsystematic  induction  of persons to man various jobs requiring requisite skills, aptitudes and values.  
3. There is no uniform promotion policy, either, to ensure fair and proper promotion opportunities to all persons. As a corollary to this, the existing personnel appraisal system, on the basis of which a man's suitability for promotion is often assessed, could also be called unscientific and casual in approach.  
3. Some  States  and  Central  Police  forces  have  gone  into  technical modernization in a big way and evidently in the near future policemen will be required to handle sophisticated equipment and work in technologically developed  surroundings.  The  recruitment  process,  therefore,  has  to  be sufficiently modified to cater to the personnel requirements needs of the future.  

VIII.  The existing systems of personnel management in the police are outdated 

and inadequate to cope with the ever growing human problems. The only alternative lies in the creation of Departments of personnel in the forces to deal exclusively with the human resources management.  

IX.  The objectives of the Department of Personnel will be to provide for a 

steady supply of competent, well-trained people at all levels and to help the operating management provide the climate wherein these people can work  together  towards  the  accomplishment  of  the  goals  of  the organization. 

**Functions of Police Personnel Wing** 

10. The   function   of   the   Department   of   Personnel   Primarily concerns the manpower  management.  Manpower    management    is   concerned   with   the   maximum utilization   of human   resources   to   help attain   the   organizational   objectives. It does so by ensuring   that   the   required   manpower is available when needed, and   that,   it   is   used   effectively.  Manpower management includes the following personnel functions:    
- Recruitment 
- Career planning 
- Promotion 
- Performance appraisal 
- Discipline 
- Grievances 
- Welfare 
- Policy and Research 

**Recruitment** 

11. The vital importance of a sound and far-sighted recruitment policy need not be over-emphasized. The absence of a definite recruitment policy leaves too wide a gap between actual job requirements and the enlisted staff. It is, therefore, necessary to 

    determine the job requirements first. For example, it has to be decided as to what type 

    of work a Constable, or a Sub-Inspector or an Assistant Superintendent of Police is 

    required  to  do  at  present  and  may  be  required  to  do  in  the  future.  Once  the requirements are defined, the next task is to select the required number and the right type of persons. Here long-term planning becomes imperative as the induction of too many persons at one stage will result in the denial of promotion and employment opportunities to a large number of persons in subsequent years. This is more so in the police  force  in  which  people  are  inducted  at  higher  levels  simultaneously.  This phenomenon is too well known to those who are familiar with the working of the police forces in which only 20 - 30% of the Constables can ever hope to go even one stage up. A proper balance, therefore, has to be worked out between recruitment at higher levels and promotion opportunities.  

    **Training** 

12. The next important function of the Department of Personnel will be training. Training programmes are said to be as good or as bad as the personnel system, and as there is no link-up, at present, between recruitment and training on the one hand, and training and placement on the other, the benefits of training are often lost. This link- up can be affected only by a Department of Personnel which has the potential to formulate  the  various  policies  concerning  the  personnel,  right  from  the  time  of recruitment.  Higher  level  of  performance  needs  carefully  planned  training  at  all levels. In-service training and training programmes for training staff are some of the methods to achieve this. 
12. **Career planning** 
1. An important function of the Department of Personnel is career planning. It is a scientific system which enables the organization to meet its current and projected manpower  needs  through  optimum  development  and  utilization  of  employees' skills and potential. Proper career planning is impossible in the present system which  does  not  provide  for  the  collection  and  processing  of  bio-data  and performance-data of the personnel, and making recommendations on the basis of these fundamental inputs. 
1. As a result, placements (postings and transfers) are made on an ad hoc basis. It will, therefore, be necessary to :- 
- identify job requirements;  
- advise on the qualifications required for each post and prepare panels for selection; 
- hunt constantly for talent; 
- select persons for specialised training. 
3. The aim should be maximisation of the career development of the individual and the operational efficiency of the force.  

**Promotion** 

14. Ill-planned promotion policies lower the morale of the force. The Department of Personnel has to formulate promotion policies for various categories on the basis of studies made of the various promotion channels, possible fluctuation in the rate of promotion, optimum ratio of promotions to direct recruitment, etc. 

    **Performance appraisal** 

15. A  proper  personnel  appraisal  system  is  vital  for  career  planning  and  is indispensable  in  matters  of  promotion  and  placements.  The  police  forces  in  this country lack proper and scientific appraisal systems. The only instrument available now is the confidential reports. An objective appraisal of the personnel can hardly be done  on  the  basis  of  the  existing  system.  One  of  the  functions  of  the  Personnel Department will be to devise a proper system of performance appraisal and to review the system periodically. In addition, the department will  also have  to process the performance appraisal reports for career planning, placement, etc. 

    **Discipline** 

16. Discipline is another important area which has to come under the purview of the Department of Personnel. Though  the responsibility of initiating  and disposing of departmental  proceedings  will  continue  to  rest  with  the  operational  authorities, processing  and  reviewing  the  departmental  enquiries  will  be  a  function  of  the Department of Personnel. 

    **Grievances** 

17. Dealing with the grievances of the staff will be one of the major functions of the Department  of  Personnel.  Individual  or  localized  grievances  concerning  housing, leave, transfer, etc., could be dealt with more effectively and promptly by the staff of the  Department  of  Personnel  at  the  district  or  unit  levels.  Collective  grievances concerning wage structure, working conditions, schooling and medical facilities, etc., will be dealt with by the Department of Personnel at the State level. The department will also serve as a liaison between the police staff associations and the head of the force. The effectiveness of the Department of Personnel will depend upon its ability to resolve the grievances of the staff promptly and efficiently. 

    **Welfare** 

18. Welfare of the force follows closely the function of grievance redressal. Positive welfare policies will have to be evolved and implemented. These should cover a host of welfare activities like accident relief, canteen, credit societies, compensation to and rehabilitation  of  handicapped  employees,  legal  and  financial  assistance,  post- retirement  employment,  vacations,  holidays,  recreation,  sports,  education  opportu- nities, travel concessions, and other facilities. Medical aid and the safety and security of personnel are also to be supervised by the Department of Personnel. 
18. **Policy and Research** 
1) The policy formulation function of the Department of Personnel covers a variety of 

subjects some of which are listed below : 

1) To   formulate   overall   policies,   in aspects   like   recruitment, promotion,                         morale, discipline, career development, training. 
1) To   undertake   studies   of   comparative   personnel   systems and their 

applicability to the force. 

3) To consult expert bodies with a view to evolving new policies. 
3) To  draft  orders,  reports  and  policy  statements  as  necessary  in  respect  of personnel management. 
3) To conduct evaluation of policies from time to time. 
3) To initiate proposals for the   creation of new posts.  
7) To   study   and   suggest   remedial   measures   for personnel problems referred to the department by operational authorities. 
7) To keep personnel policies constantly under review. 
2) The  area**  of  greatest  contribution  for  the  Department  of  Personnel  is  that  of innovating and introducing changes and raising the quality of employee performance to  higher  levels  than  before.  It  means  keeping  abreast  of  new  developments  and introducing  new  ideas  which  might  contribute  to  growth.  The  twin  objective  of personnel management reforms should be to preserve and strengthen the good points of  the  existing  system  and  simultaneously  to  find  remedies  for  the  prominent shortcomings of the old system. 
2) Personnel management has to cope with several new problems that are bound to arise  as  time  goes  by.  Continuous  research  on  the  basic  aspects  of  personnel management can, to a certain extent, anticipate problems of the future and devise means to deal with them. 

   **The Structure of the Police Personnel Departments** 

20. The Department of Personnel at the State level will be headed by a Director of the rank of Addl. DGP/Inspector-General of Police. The officer should be senior enough to  project  effectively  the  personnel  polices.  It  is  relevant  to  quote  the  recom- mendations of the Study Team of the Administrative Reforms Commission regarding the  selection  of  the  senior  staff  of  the  Department  of  Personnel.  "If  the  new Department of Personnel is to make a decisive impact on personnel administration in the Government  of India,  its head should be  no one  less than  a  Secretary  to  the Government of India." 
20. **The Wings** 
1) The Department of Personnel will have five wings each under a Deputy Director assisted by Assistant Directors depending on the size of the force and the relative importance of the wings :- 
1. **Recruitment A Staffing Wing** 

   Recruitment policy for all levels, Liaison with   Employment Exchange, State 

   Public Service Commissions, recruitment boards. 

   Fixation of ratio of promotions to direct recruitments 

2. **Training Wing** 

 ¾Formulation and coordination of various training policies;  ¾Police   Training   Colleges and   Recruit   Training Schools;  ¾In-service training programmes, 

 ¾Publication of training material; 

 ¾Liaison with other training institutions. 

3. **Career Planning Wing** 

 ¾Performance appraisal system; 

 ¾Determination of job requirements and man specifications; 

 ¾To  hunt  constantly  for  talent  by  identifying  positions  requiring  special 

qualifications and by developing systems and methods to spot and develop the needed special talents; 

 ¾Liaise  with  other  Ministries  and  departments  where  police  personnel  are 

deputated. 

4. **Discipline and Welfare Wing** 

 ¾Conduct and discipline policies; 

 ¾Processing of departmental enquiries; 

 ¾Legal advice; 

 ¾Redressal of grievances; 

 ¾Salary and wage structure; 

 ¾Matters relating to police staff associations; 

 ¾All matters relating to welfare; 

 ¾Medical facilities;                                                                      ¾Sports activities; 

 ¾Motivation and incentives; 

 ¾Resettlement of retired police personnel 

5. **Research, Policy and Planning Wing** 

    ¾Research on problems concerning Department of Personnel e.g.:  ¾Recruitment methods and selection techniques; 

    ¾Promotion policies and transfer policies; 

    ¾Performance appraisal; 

    ¾Staffing pattern; 

    ¾Manpower forecast and planning; 

    ¾Morale, motivation and incentives; 

    ¾Conduct and discipline; 

    ¾Comparative   personnel   systems,    attitude   surveys; 

    ¾Need for specialisation. 

    ¾Drafting    reports,    policy  statements  and  orders  relating  to  personnel 

management; 

 ¾Reference from and to Pay Commissions and other bodies;  

 ¾Review   and   evaluation   of   existing   policies   and   rules;  

 ¾Advising unit officers on policy interpretation 

2) At the district or unit operational level, the Superintendent of Police or Battalion Commander also performs many functions relating to personnel which require the assistance of the Department of Personnel. A certain degree of decentralization of the Department of Personnel will facilitate this process. An officer of the rank of an Additional  Superintendent  of  Police  be  posted  in  each  district/unit  to  assist  the district/unit head in matters relating to personnel management. 
2) The Zone Inspector General of Police, Range Deputy Inspector-General of Police also has to deal with matters concerning personnel management. He can draw the necessary assistance in these matters from the force level Personnel Department. 
2) The  Additional  Superintendent  of  Police  will  assist  the  Superintendent  of Police/Unit Commander in the following matters : 
- Recruitment of constables 
- Transfer of Sub-Inspectors,   Head Constables and Constables 
- In-service   training   of Sub-Inspectors,   Head   Constables and Constables 
- Performance    appraisal    of    Sub-Inspectors,    Head    Constables  and Constables 
- Processing of departmental disciplinary proceedings 
- Redressal of grievances 
- Welfare and Sports activities 
- Maintenance of personnel record system 
- Resettlement of retired police personnel 
5) Utmost care should be taken in the selection of the man to head the Department of Personnel. He is the chief personnel officer who deals directly with the top executive and bears the responsibility for the complete mission of the personnel function. He must have wide experience in matters pertaining to personnel management, training, welfare  and  all  other  functions  of  the  Department.  He  must  have  the  confidence required to interface with the head of the force. 
5) The  following  blue-print  for  o  whole  time  body  which  would  undertake personnel  planning  for  the  State  Police  Forces  in  India  deserves  serious  study  at forums of senior police officers : 
1) There will be a Directorate of Personnel for every Force.  The Director will ordinarily be of the rank of Inspector-General of Police.  The object of giving him such high status is to ensure that he possesses enough authority to make his  presence  felt  and  is  also  in  a  position  to  directly  liaise  with  the Government. 
1) The Director will be assisted by a Deputy Director (with the rank of IG/D.I.G.) who will be the Staff Officer and relieve the former of his day-to-day routine.  There will be another Deputy Director who will be a field officer and to whom trouble-shooting  exercises will be  entrusted  for  personal  attention. He  will maintain  active  contact  with  all  operational  units  which  are  required  to formulate and implement subsidiary plans. 
1) Apart  from  preparing  a  perspective  plan  far  personnel  management  to  be updated  from  time  to  time  and  which  would  cover  the  entire  Force,  the Directorate of Personnel would 
1. formulate  recruitment  policies  and  standardize  procedures  for selection; 
1. assist the Force headquarters in manpower planning; 
1. assist it in initiating welfare activities so that uniform standards are ensured throughout the Force; 
4. assist the field officers in the matter of communicating with their men on policy matters; and 
4. maintain close liaison with the Government to monitor plan proposals and their acceptance, 
4) In  every  District  there  will  be  a  Planning  Officer  of  the  rank  of  Deputy Superintendent  whose  responsibility  will  be  to  formulate  perspective  and short-term personnel plans for his District and submit them to the concerned Range Deputy Inspector-General of Police through the District Superintendent of Police. While the latter will not have day-to-day planning responsibility and will be allowed to concentrate on his primary tasks of preservation of peace and prevention and detection of crime. He will broadly oversee the work of the Deputy Superintendent (Planning) so as to satisfy himself that planning tasks receive adequate attention.  He should step in effectively when he feels that progress on this front is not adequate. 
4) Although it would be the responsibility of the above Deputy Superintendent and the Range Deputy Inspector-General to formulate personnel plans, their implementation (after acceptance of each District plan by the Directorate of Personnel) would be the task of field officers such as Sub-Divisional Officers and Inspectors.  In this process they would, of course, receive the required guidance from the Deputy Superintendent (Planning) and the Range Deputy Inspector-General who are expected to monitor and ensure implementation of plans.

**Manpower Planning: Parameters &**  

**the Police Contexts** 

**Introduction** 

22. Manpower planning is the scientific process of evolving the right quantity of right men, required in future, at the right time, for the right job. This is a process by which it is determined as to how the organisation should move from its current manpower position to its desired manpower position. In the police contexts this process is often defined as re-organisation of police. 

    **Main Features** 

23. Manpower planning aims at ascertaining the manpower needs of the organisation both in right number and right kind. It includes an inventory of present manpower in order  to  determine  the  status  of  the  present  supply  of  available  personnel  and  to discover undeveloped talent within the organisation. It also assesses future manpower requirements. Manpower planning must focus not only on the people involved but also on the working conditions and relationships in which they work. 

    **Basic Elements** 

24. The basic elements of manpower planning should be : forecasting the future needs of  manpower,  developing  a  sound  requirement  and  selection  procedure.  Proper utilization of available manpower and controlling and reviewing the cost of work involved through manpower. 

    **Objectives** 

25. Specific objectives of manpower planning are :  
1) making correct estimate of manpower requirements,  
1) managing the manpower according to needs** of the organisation,  
1) helping in recruitment and selection,  
1) maintaining production and service levels,  
5) making employees development programme effective,  
5) establishing harmonious relations,  
5) reduction in labour costs and minimisation of labour wastage. 

**Nature of Manpower Planning** 

26. Manpower  planning  is  a  continuous  process.  Nobody  will  like  the  idea  of recruiting manpower for the ultimate capacity in the first stage and pay for idle hours and induce in the staff with chronicity for lower efficiency. Manpower assessment is to be done every year, and should be revised periodically at fixed intervals keeping in view the organisations tasks and programmes of the year to cover and time required for introduction and training. For carrying out a healthy and fool proof manpower planning, an efficient, experienced, and highly skilled and qualified staff should be provided within the organisational structure. 

    **The Constraints** 

27. The manpower planning is a continuous and dynamic process. It should be looked upon by considering various limitations imposed upon the planning department. The national employment policy, organisational instructions, dynamics of the social and political  forces  which  affect  the  financial,  production,  marketing  and  general management  policies  of  the  organisation  should  be  taken  into  account  when manpower planning process is in the pipeline. For effective manpower planning the job analysis, job description and job evaluation should be carried out, and then the element of uncertainty and probability of failure should be considered. 

    **Factors Affecting Manpower Planning** 

28. Manpower  planning  is  one  of  the  most  complex,  dynamic,  critical  and complicated task. A number of factors have to be considered for an effective and efficient  manpower  planning.   A  few  important  factors  generally  considered  in manpower planning are working hours/number of shifts, nature of work, duties mix, performance parameters and hours lost and hours spent on duty. 

    **Importance of Manpower Planning** 

29. A  sound  personnel  policy  requires  that  there  should  be  adequate  number  of persons  of  the  right  type  to  attain  its  objectives.  Personnel  objectives  cannot  be achieved without proper manpower planning. The importance of manpower planning can  be  judged  on  factors  like  increase  in  the  size  of  work,  functions  and  duties, effective  recruitment  and  selection  policy,  effective  employee  development programmes,  reduction  in  cost,  efficient  work  force,  avoiding  disruption  in production, good public relations, and working on the national policy on employment. 

    **Pre-requisites for Manpower Planning** 

30. Goals or objectives of business, support of top level management, well organised personnel  department,  determination  of  related  policies,  responsibility  fixing, planning period and manpower standards are some of the important pre-requisites of manpower planning. 

    **The Process** 

31. Manpower planning is a multi-step process consisting of deciding objectives of manpower  planning,  estimating  future  manpower  requirements,  auditing  human resources,  planning  job  requirements  and  job  descriptions  or  job  analysis  and developing a human resource plan. 

    **The Police Contexts** 

32. The system of manpower planning in the police has not been able to obtain a systematic, scientific and stable shape. The manpower needs are not assessed on a regular basis or on regular fixed intervals. Rather, such an exercise is undertaken after a long lapse of time, which at times may be more than a couple of decades. Such an   effort in the police parlance is called re-organisation. In this context, a committee is often constituted which takes stock of the present state of manpower available, and in the  context  of  existing  work  load  and  the  future  needs,  prepares  a  report  for  the increase, revision and modification of force in various police units. The committee report is sent to the government, which if accepted, is often implemented in phases.  

    32\.1  This  ad-hoc  or  emergent  process  must  be  replaced  with  some  systematic, scientific  and  stable  arrangement.  Each  State  Police  Organisation  and  the  CPOs should  establish  a  manpower  planning  wing  under  their  personnel  management system. This wing should be given the responsibilities to take stock of the present state of manpower available, its adequacy and utility in the contemporary contexts, and in the light of future needs. Such an assessment, if done critically, systematically and  regularly will  evolve  a system  to work  out the demands  made  on the  police system for induction, revision and revaluation of manpower in various police units. Such  an  exercise  when  undertaken  on  regular  basis  would  help  the  recruitment, selection and promotion processes to be more effective, goal oriented, rationalized and systematic.  

    **Job Analysis, Description and Specification: Introduction** 

33. Job analysis is the process of determining by observation, analysis and study, for reporting pertinent information relating to the nature of a specific job. It elaborates and specifies the tasks which comprise the job and of the skills, knowledge, abilities and responsibilities required by the employee for a successful performance. The job- analysis components also differentiate one job from the other jobs. The duty of the personnel department is to find out accurate information about the knowledge, skill, experience,  and  competencies  that  an  individual  should  possess  to  perform  a particular job. Job analysis is a process by which a job, its duties and responsibilities are defined and the information of various factors relating to jobs are collected and compiled to determine the work and conditions, nature of work, qualities of persons to be employed on job, position of the job, opportunities available and authorities and privileges assigned to a specific job. 

    33\.1 The first  operative function  of personnel  management  is  the  procurement  of personnel  for  the  organisation  to  fill  up  future  job  vacancies  and  making  the employement, selection and hiring practices more effective. No proper selection is possible without the precise knowledge of the duties, responsibilities, authorities and conditions  of  the  work  job.  This  process  places  a  right  man  on  the  right  job.  A thorough job study is required before procurement of the personnel. Job description and its analysis are the fundamental techniques for making the job study meaningful. Job analysis is an essential ingredient in designing a sound personnel programme. 

    **Purpose and Objectives** 

34. The main purpose of job analysis is to describe and define the distinctions among various jobs in the organisation and their relationships. In job analysis information like content of a job, difference in the nature of various jobs, tasks involved in the job, need for professional requisites, equipment and tools required both for the job and the job holder. The requirements of the job are known as 'job description' and the qualities demanded from a job holder are termed as 'job specifications'. Job analysis consists of assessment,  assimilation  and  evaluation  of  various  parameters  related  with  job description and job specifications. Job descriptions consists of various factors like job title, location, summary of duties, detailed statement of work to be performed, tools, equipment, machines, materials, responsibility, qualifications, working conditions, job hazards, and relation of the job with other jobs. Likewise job analysis would also consists  of  items  like  education,  experience,  training,  skills,  aptitude,  initiative, responsibilities, analysis and judgment ability, adaptability, mental and visual demand and emotional characteristics of the incumbent. 

    **Significance of Job Analysis** 

35. Job analysis is an essential ingredient in designing a sound personnel programme. Job analysis may be used for the following purposes: 
- Organisation and manpower planning 
- Recruitment and selection 
- Training and development 
- Wage and salary administration 
- Performance appraisal 
- Job re-engineering 
- Health and safety 

**Process of Job Analysis** 

36. Following steps are undertaken during the process of job analysis. 
- Collection of factual material 
- Developing a job-description 
- Developing job specification 
- Preparation of report 
- Approval 
- Implementation 

**Methods of Job Analysis** 

37. Following methods are employed to collect information for job-analysis. 
- Questionnaire 
- Check -list 
- Observation 
- Interview 
- Record 
- Participation 
- Technical conference 

**Characteristics of Job Description** 

38. A good job description must possess the following characteristics.  
1. It  should  be  kept  up  to  date  i.e.,  necessary  adjustments  should  be incorporated from time to time. 
1. Job title should be short, definite and suggestive as to indicate the nature of the work. 
1. Duties and responsibilities should be clearly defined. 
1. Job description should give a clear, concise and readily understandable picture of the whole job. A new employee should understand the job if he reads the job-description. 
1. Statements and opinions of general nature should be avoided. 
1. Job specifications should be mentioned clearly. 
1. It should be descriptive but concise. 
1. Every item should be exactly and clearly worded. 
1. Job description should clearly mention the job specifications. 
10. Special work conditions and special qualifications for the job should be clearly explained. 

**Utility of Job- Description** 

39\. Job description has following uses :  

1. Preliminary  drafts  can  be  used  as  a  basis  for  productive  group discussion, particularly if the process starts at the executive level. 
1. It aids in the development of job specifications which are useful in planning,  recruitment,  training  and  hiring  of  people  with  required skills. 
1. It can be used to orient new employees towards basic responsibilities and duties. 
1. It is a basic document used in developing performance standards. 
1. It  can  be used  for  job evaluation  a  wage  and  salary  administration technique. 
1. A job description enables the recruiter to frame suitable questions to be asked during an interview. 
1. A  job  description  becomes  a  vehicle  for  organisational  change  and improvement. It helps top executives in fixing the responsibilities.  

**Contents of Job - Specification** 

40. Job specifications are developed with the cooperation of the personnel department and  various  supervisors  in  the  whole  organisation.  The  personnel  department coordinates  the  writing  of  job  descriptions  and  job-specifications  and  secures agreement on the qualifications required. These specifications include the following: 
1) **Physical characteristics,*** which include health, strength, endurance, age-range, body-size, height, weight, vision, voice, poise, eye, hand and foot coordination, motor coordination etc. 
1) **Psychological  characteristics,***  which  include  judgment,  resourcefulness, analytical ability, decision-making ability, alterness etc. 
1) **Personal  characteristics,***  which  include  appearance,  manners,  leadership, cooperativeness, initiative, drive, mental stability etc, 
4) **Responsibilities,*** which include supervision capabilities sense of responsibility, commitment, responsiveness and loyalty etc. 
4) **Other features of a demographic nature*** such as age, sex, education, experience etc. 

   **The Police Perspective** 

41. In the absence of a regular department/wing of man power planning in the police department  the  important  parameters  of  personnel  management  like  job  analysis, description and specification do not receive adequate attention and a proper handling. In  the  absence  of  proper  job  analysis,  proper  assessment  of  requisite  traits  and potentials expected from the prospective recruits and employees are not developed. Consequently, there are difficulties in identifying and recruiting appropriate personnel at different ranks. When job analysis is not done properly the further steps of job description and job specification also suffer with a raw deal. As a net result the role profile of the personnel becomes diffused and the role performance and execution of the various tasks by the police ranks tent to be out of proportion, when view in the light of job expectation and job aspiration. It is therefore, essential that the personnel department is established with adequate powers, responsibilities and wherewithal to look into the important aspects of manpower planning, job analysis, job description and job specification.  

**Chapter 3** 

**Recruitment, Selection & Placement** 

**Introduction** 

42. Personnel department procures and maintains an adequate qualified working force of various jobs necessary for manning an organisation. Efficient personnel force leads the  organisation  to  success.  This  calls  for  proper  determination  of  manpower requirements.  Procurement  function  of  personnel  department  includes  three  major sub-functions: Recruitment, Selection, and Placement. Recruitment means search of prospective  employees  to  suit  the  job  requirements  as  represented  by  job specification; a technique of job analysis. Out of the prospective applicants, right types of persons to match the jobs are selected. Under placement, the selected person is placed on the job which is suited to him. 

    **Meaning of Recruitment** 

43. After assessment of manpower requirements, recruitment is the next logical step in the staffing process.  Recruitment is the process of identifying the sources for prospective candidates and to stimulate them to apply for the jobs. Recruitment is the process of discovering the potential applicants for actual or anticipated organizational vacancies. It is a "linking activity" brining together those with the jobs and those seeking jobs. Recruitment is a positive process because it increases the selection ratio by attracting a large number of applicants for the jobs. The function of recruitment is two fold: to discover sources of manpower, and to attract an adequate number of prospective employees. 

    **Source of Recruitment** 

44. The sources of recruitment fall into two categories: Internal and external. 
1) **Internal Sources :** Internal sources include personnel already on the payroll of the  organization.  Whenever  any  vacancy  arises,  somebody  from  within  the organisation may be looked into. This consists of two methods i.e. promotion and transfer.  
1) **Promotion:**  Promotion  means  shifting  of  an  employee  to  a  higher  position carrying higher responsibilities, facilities, status and salaries. Various positions in an organisation are usually filled up by promotion of existing employees on the basis of merit or seniority or a combination of these. 
1) **Transfer  :**  Transfer  refers  to  a  change  in  job  assignment.  It  may  be  either temporary  or  permanent,  depending  on  the  necessity  of  filling  jobs.  Promotion involves upward mobility while transfer refers to a horizontal mobility of employees. 
1. **Advantages :** Internal sources of recruitment have the advantages of familiarity, better utilisation of internal talent, economy and motivational value. 
1. **Limitations  :**  The  limitations  this  methodology  are  :  restricted  choice,  in- breeding,  absence  of  competition  and  generating  internal  conflict  among  the employee. 
2) **External  sources  :**  External  sources  of  recruitment  refer  to  prospective candidates  outside  the  organisation.  They  are  new  entrants  to  the  organisation. Common  external  sources  are  :  advertising,  employment  agencies,  gate  hiring, educational institutions, employee recommendations, labour unions, leasing, waiting lists, field trips, unsolicited applications, labour contractors and ex-employees. 
45. **Advantages :** Advantages of external sources of recruitment are availability of wide options, infusion of new blood and element of competition. 

    45\.1  **Limitations  :**  Limitations  of  external  source  of  recruitment  are  :  frustration among existing employees, high expense, time consuming and lack of certainty. 

    **Elements of a Good Recruitment Policy :**  

46. A  recruitment  policy  avoids  hasty  and ill  considered  decisions.  The  principle elements of a sound recruitment policy are as follows :  
1) Identification of recruitment needs i.e., manpower planning 
1) Preferred sources of recruitment 
1) Criteria of selection and selection techniques 

**Prerequisites** 

47. Following are the prerequisites of a good recruitment policy :  
- It  should  be  in  conformity  with  its  general  personnel  policies  and organisation's objectives. 
- It should be flexible enough to meet the changing needs of an organisation. 
- It should be designed to ensure employment opportunities for its employees on a long-term basis so that the goals of the organisation should be achievable and it should develop the potential of its employees. 
- It should match the qualities of employees with the requirements of the work for which they are employed. 
- It should highlight the necessity of establishing job analysis. 
- It should assure employees fairness in all employment relationships including promotions and transfers. 

**Selection Process** 

48. A planned recruitment programme provides for a job application form required for making selections. The selection process will divide the candidates into two classes i.e. those who will be called for employment and those who will be rejected. It is part of the elementary process. A good selection process ensures procurement of qualified and skilled incumbents with reduced cost of training and development with absence of personnel problems. 

    **Process of Selection** 

49. Selection  is  the  process  of  logically  choosing  individuals  who  posses  the necessary skills, abilities and personality traits to successfully execute specific jobs in the organisation. The selection process is entirely dependent upon proper manpower planning and recruitment. To ensure the selection of right type of persons for various jobs steps and techniques may be adopted in a systematic manner as part of scientific and  vocational  selection.  This  would  involve  knowledge  regarding  the  qualities required for doing a given job properly and measurement of qualities possessed by a candidate. There activities are known as "job specification" i.e., "job analysis" and "job grading". 

    **Procedure for selection** 

50. Various steps of the selection procedure may be described as under :  
1. Application blank 
1. Screening application forms 
1. Employment tests 
1. Interviewing 
1. Reference checks 
1. Selection decision 
1. **Selection  Forms  :**  Information  on  application  forms  is  used  for  selection purposes. Sometimes, detailed information is sought from the prospective employees. The criteria for the contents of the application form are generally to get data that are primarily factual. 
1. **Selection Test :** A selection test is an instrument designed to measure selected qualities and abilities of a prospective incumbent in terms of job specifications. Such tests may be classified as intelligence tests, aptitude tests, achievement tests, interest tests, personality tests, and interviewing and reference checks. 

   **Principles of Recruitment** 

51. Following are the important principles of recruitment. 
- Recruitment  policies,  principles  and  parameters  for  the  whole  organisation should be handled by the personnel department of the apex level. 
- Internal and external sources of recruitment should be provided and adequate educated.  
- Recruitment policies followed in similar organisations should be considered. 
- Recruitment needs should be properly identified. The personnel department should prepare the profiles for each category of workers and accordingly work out the main specifications, decide the sections, departments or business where they should be placed and identify the particular responsibilities which may be immediately assigned to them. 
- Statutory provisions regarding recruitment of personnel should be considered. 
- The recruitment policy should be elastic to be amended suitably to achieve the organisational objectives. 
- Recruitment policy should be in conformity with general personnel policies. 
- The  qualifications  of  the  applicants  should  commensurate  with  the  job specifications. 
- Basis of recruitment whether recruit, merit or senconvis cum merit etc should be properly edeuliber. 

` `**Principles of Selection Policy** 

52. Important principles of selection policy are following. 
- Selection of employees should be assigned to an efficient and qualified selection agency. 
- "Job first, man next" should be the basic and fundamental principle for selection. 
- Selection source could be single or multiple i.e. it can from internal as well as external sources. 
- There should be some standards with which a prospective employee may be compared. These should be available, before hand like a comprehensive job description and job specifications. If suitable candidate is not available the post should remain vacant till such time a right man is available. 
- Selection policy should be within the frame-work of personnel policy and organisation policy. 
- The selection policy of the organisation should be commensurate with the employment policy of the government. 
- There must be a sufficient number of applicants from whom the required number of employees may be selected. 
- Selection  policy  should  be  flexible;  not  rigid  so  that  necessary amendments may be made whenever necessary. 
- The selection policy should be unbiased and organisaton oriented. 
- The  selection  policy  should  provide  the  vocational  guidance  for prospective candidates. 

**Recruitment and Selection Practices in India** 

53. Some special features of recruitment and selection in India are as follows : 
- There is a great disproportion between the number of positions available and the number of aspirants. Sometimes the ratio is as much as 1:100 or even more.  Evaluation  of  such  a  large  number  of  candidates  is  expensive  and inconvenient. 
- Persons with little or no experience are open recmtap consequently the new recruits have great difficulty in adjusting themselves to the rhythm, discipline and relationships parameters of the organisation. 
- Under the existing statues dismissal of an employee is very difficult. A person once recruited is going to be around for long. 
- Manpower planning has not yet become popular and is practiced only by a few big organisation. 
- Different  types  of  recruitment  are  prevalent  in  the  country.  The  following methods are used to recruit employees in organisations. 
1. Employment Exchanges 
1. Internal advertisements 
1. Central Training Insitute 
1. Deputation personnel 
1. Transfers from other public undertakings 
1. Relatives and friends of the employees 

**Sources of Recruitment** 

54. The major sources of recruitment are : 
- Advertisements 
- Employments Exchanges 
- Relatives and friends 
- Casual callers 
- Ex- employee's dependents 

**Recruitment & Selection Procedures of Police** 

55. Personnel development has not made much progress in police. Personnel policies, techniques and practices adopted by police are not very good. Some problems are as follows: 
1. Defective recruitment policies 
1. Old selection techniques 
1. Untrained selectors 
1. Prejudication 
1. Lack of manpower planning 
1. Attitude of employers 

**Selection Tests** 

56. Following tests are adopted for selection & recruitment of employees. 
- Intelligence tests 
- Aptitude tests 
- Interest tests 
- Physical Measurement & Physical Endurance Test 
- Personality tests 
- Achievement tests 

**Police Recruitment Contexts** 

57. The role of the police is becoming more and more complex in the new social context. They have now to be more than ever conscious of their role in safeguarding and fostering the processes of socio economic growth and development and ensuring social justice. They are responsible for preserving the democratic order of society and uphold the Constitutional provisions. In this restless and turbulent age, the challenges to established authority have made the task of the police delicate and exacting. The political, social, economic, regional, linguistic tensions, violent and heinous crimes and host of other factors have brought about a qualitative change in the nature and degree of the responsibility of the police in India. The induction of liberal principles of social defence into various aspects of law enforcement, the progress of science and technology and a very large number of social and other enactments have added to the volume and complexity of police work.  
1. Police exercise direct coercive influence on the individual citizen. They have been given discretion in order that they can be effective and responsive to the needs of the public. Their role calls upon them to make quick, perceptive judgments in the thick of conflict and in the glare of public scrutiny and errors of judgments on their part can cause irreparable harm. Policing in a modern society, therefore, calls for a deep insight into human behaviour and a pragmatic approach. 
1. These  considerations  call  for  persons  of  exceptional  ability,  intelligence  and alertness and a high level of physical courage and stamina. Besides, they should be honest and impartial und men of character. The quality of the police officers recruited in the coming years will affect the standards of performance of the force for more than  quarter  of  a  century  and  will  provide  the  leadership  which  will  face  the challenges not only of today but also of the next two or three decades. The importance of sound recruitment procedures is, therefore, crucial. 
1. However good the organisational structure, the procedures and the methods, it is the personnel who translate policy into action. Recruitment procedures must, there- fore, keep in view the need for selecting the best and most suitable men in relation to the functions not only of the rank to which recruitment is made, but also of the higher ranks to which the candidate may become eligible in course of time. 
1. The nature of the police role in a democracy requires that the members should be selected impartially; they should be administratively competent, politically neutral, and imbued with the spirit of selfless service. The recruitment procedures should, therefore,  be  so  devised  that  they  are  free  from  political,  personal  or  corruptive influences. The need for objectivity in selection cannot be over-emphasized. 
1. It is necessary to ensure that no bias operates against any section of the people in the recruitment process. If it is found that any particular section is not, represented adequately, the reasons for this situation may be looked into for such action as may be necessary.  
6. The recruitment procedure begins by laying down the qualifications and the cri- teria for the eligibility of candidates for particular posts. The nature of these quali- fications is dictated partly by the requirements of the job and partly by the availability in  the  community  of  persons  with  particular  qualities  and  qualifications.  The availability in its turn depends partly on the emoluments offered, partly on the job opportunities  and  attractiveness  and  partly  on  the  way  the  educational  and  other allocative mechanisms in society function.  
6. Among the qualifications specified for recruitment to the police are age, educa- tion,  intellectual  ability,  physical  fitness  and  personal  qualities.  The  age  and educational  qualifications  are  easily  assessed.  Physical  fitness  and  suitability  are sought to be judged through field tests and medical examination, psychological tests and pre-entry orientation. 

   **Psychological Tests** 

58. Different procedures should be adopted to ascertain whether an individual has the intellectual  ability  and  personal  qualities  required  for  post.  Many  tests  are  being employed  in  different  countries  for  appointments  to  the  police.  These  tests  are designed to furnish information as to the level of the intelligence of the person tested, his  aptitude  for  specified  jobs  and  the  conscious  and  sub-conscious  trends  in  his personality. The results of these tests put together can form a basis for forecasting the suitability of a person for a particular job. In the western countries psychological tests are being used in several police forces, which can be adopted for recruitment process for the police personnel. 
1. In  Delhi,  candidates  for  appointment  as  Constables  are  administered  certain psychological  tests  to  evaluate  their  motivation  for  the  police  service,  emotional stability and I.Q. rating. Intelligence and psychological tests were recommended for Constables and Sub-Inspectors by the Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal Police Commissions and the working group of the Administrative Reforms Commission on police Administration. Properly developed psychological tests, administered by well qualified and competent psychologists, can make a useful contribution in the police selection process. It is obvious that the tests would be different for the different ranks of the police and a good deal of work will have to be done by way of research and field trials for developing suitable tests. A small cell should be set up in the Bureau of Police  Research  and  Development  consisting  of  one  or  two  psychologists  which should undertake this work expeditiously and on a whole-time basis. An Advisory Committee consisting of a few senior psychologists may be associated with the work of  the  cell  so  that  it  is  carried  on  along  correct  lines.  This  cell  can  advise  the recruitment agencies of State police force. 
2. Carefully selected psychologists may be attached to all police forces to function in the first instance as counseling psychologists.  
2. Great care is needed in the selection of persons for direct appointment to the higher ranks of the police, namely, the Sub-Inspector, the Deputy Superintendent and the Assistant Superintendent of Police. The procedures of their selection should be such as can asses, in addition to the qualities needed for police work, the qualities of leadership, decision-making and task-performance, and capacity to withstand stress and strain and to react to failure in the proper light.  

   **Pre-entry Orientation** 

59. Like any other profession, the police also require personnel who have an aptitude for or interest in police work. In order to create this interest among the youth, it might be useful to expose them to police work during their school/college education and to extend the study of criminology in the universities. 

    **Police Cadet System** 

60. The U.K. gave a lead by introducing a police cadet system as far back as 1935 and that similar systems are now in vogue in some States of the U.S.A., in Australia and in a number of continental countries with variations to suit local conditions. In brief the system  provides  for  a  job  category  known  as  cadet  which  is  below  the  rank  of Constable.  Young  men,  who  meet  the  basic  requirements  for  appointment  to  the police force, but for age, are selected as cadets. This system should be adopted by the state police organisation for pre-orientation to police for the prospective recruitees. 
1. On  the  completion  of  the  prescribed  period  of  time  in  cadet  status  and  on reaching the minimum age of entry into the police, they are considered for regular appointment 35 Constables. The added advantage of such a scheme for a country like India is that since all those who join as cadets will not necessarily remain in the police, all those who remain outside will constitute an increasing section among the people who have a fair understanding of the role of the police, their difficulties and problems and the value of cooperating with them in the solution of social problems.  
1. It should be possible to introduce some aspects of the police administration in academic courses from the school stage onwards in the syllabus of such subjects as civics, political science and sociology and there could even be a subject of police science by itself at the degree level on the analogy of the subject of military science. This could be supplemented, for outdoor work, by a Police Cadet Corps on the lines of the National Cadet Corps (N.C.C.), which students could join voluntarily.  

   **National Service Corps Scheme** 

61. A scheme was drawn up by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and instructions were issued to the various State Governments   in   June 1970 for the inclusion of a police programme in the National Service Corps scheme.  The State Governments and the police as well as the educational authorities in the States should implement it with all   the   earnestness   at their command.   This scheme should be of positive help in bringing about among students a greater understanding of the role of the police.  

    **Study of Criminology** 

62. The States have made no provision for some preference to be   given to graduates holding degrees /diplomas in criminology in their rules for the recruitment of police officers of various ranks. Criminology should be one of the optional subjects for the competitive examinations held at the Centre end in the States. 

**Chapter 4** 

**Recruitment of Constable** 

**Introduction** 

63. Constabulary plays a very significant role in the police department. Constable's duties are not limited to mechanical tasks. Most of his duties have to be performed with understanding, tact, sympathy and firmness. He has at times, to deal with situa- tions by himself until the arrival of superior officers. He has to apprise and report incidents to his superiors deal with juvenile offenders and victims of social crimes and protect the rights of the non-affluent sections of society. With the introduction of Panchayati  Raj,  he  has  to  deal  with  elected  representatives  of  the  people,  village headmen and other officials appointed by the Government at the village level. The   importance of the constabulary lies in the fact that they constitute the major part of the force, are the first to come into contact with the general public and the impressions of the people regarding the conduct of the constabulary contribute greatly to the image of the police. 

    **Recruitment Prerequisites** 

64. The physical, mental and professional traits and potentials required for efficient performance  of  constables’  duties  necessitate  that  the  process,  methods  and procedures for the recruitment of constables must be sound, scientific and systematic so  as  to  be  capable  and  competent  to  attract  suitable  candidates  for  filling  the vacancies and screen them to finally select the best out of the available lot. Following parameters for the recruitment of the constables should be adopted. 
1) **Educational Qualification** 
65. Police  Commissions  and  the  working  group  of  the  Administrative  Reforms Commission  on  Police  Administration  have  recommended  that  the  minimum educational  qualification  for  recruitment  to  the  rank  of  Constable  should  be  the Higher  Secondary  or  the  Matriculation  or  an  equivalent  examination.  A  higher standard of education is required and the overwhelming opinion is in favour of the High  School  or  an  equivalent  examination  being  prescribed  as  the  minimum educational qualification for the recruitment of Constables. 
1. In prescribing the minimum educational qualification for a Constable, it should be noted that, on promotion to the rank of Head Constable, he may be required to undertake even investigation of cases or to hold charge of an outpost independently.  
1. The  High  School  examination  or  its  equivalent  should  be  the  minimum educational qualification for the recruitment of Constables both in the unarmed and the  armed  branches  of  the  police  uniformly  throughout  the  country.  The  effort, however, should be to attract candidates with higher educational qualifications.  
2) **Age** 
66. The minimum age prescribed at present is eighteen years.  The minimum age should be eighteen years and the maximum 20. In the case of candidates possessing higher educational    qualifications,   the latter may be relaxed up to two years. It the case of the scheduled castes/tribes candidates, relaxation up to five years may be given but in    no case should the gap between the completion of education and entry into the police be more than three years. 
3) **Physical Standards**  
67. A policeman performing law enforcement functions works among the people all the  time,  especially  while  maintaining  order.  His  build  and  appearance  have, therefore, a direct impact on his effectiveness. A policeman standing in a crowd has a better view if he is taller than the average citizen He is also likely, in that case, to be more effective. The height prescribed in different States in India varies from 160 cm to  170.18  cm  (5'3"  to  5'7").  In  the  Border  Security  Force,  the  minimum  height prescribed is 165 cm (5'5") for hill tribes, Gorkhas, Garhwalis, Kumaonis and Dogras, 162.5 cm (5'4") for Adivasis of Bihar and adjacent areas and 170.18 cm (5'7") for the rest. A minimum height of 170.17 cm (5'7") was recommended by the Delhi Police Commission and 167.(54 cm (5'6") by the Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar Commissions and the working group of the Administrative Reforms Commission on Police Administration. The West Bengal Police Commission favoured the former for Biharis and upcoun-trymen and the latter for Bengalis and Santhals. The Assam and Maharashtra Commissions recommended a minimum height of 165 cm (5'5") and 162.5 cm (5'4") respectively for local considerations. Each State Police Organisation may decide on a suitable height as per its general physical and height standard of the population. 
4) **Other Measurements** 
68. The deflated chest measurement varies from 78.74 cm (31") to 81.28 cm (32") in the States. In the Border Security Force, it is 76.2 cm (30") for Adivasis of Bihar and adjacent areas and 80 cm (31J") for the rest. The minimum chest measurement recom- mended by the Police Commissions varies from 78.74 cm (31") to 81.28 cm (32") with an expansion of 5.08 cm (2"). 

    68\.1 For recruitment to the Army, minimum weights are also laid down for different height and chest measurements. In the Police, however, no minimum weight has been prescribed, except in West Bengal and Tripura, where it is 54.53 kg (120 lbs) and 

    51\.71 kg (114 lbs) respectively. According to Army standards, it should be 54 kg for 168 cm height and 52 kg for 162 cm height. 

    **General Physical Standards** 

69. Following norms should be adopted for the recommended of constables
1) The minimum height should not be less than 167.64 cm (5'6") in general for both the unarmed and the armed branches and 165 cm (5'5") in the case of men from the hill  and  tribal  areas.  This  may  be  raised  or  relaxed  in  the  different  States  or  for selected areas of a particular State for ethnological reasons.  
1) The  minimum  chest  measurement  should  be  78.74  cm  (31")  unexpanded  and 
   82. cm (33")* expanded for those whose height is 167.64 cm (5'6"), and 76.2 cm (30") unexpanded and 81.28 cm (32") expanded for those whose height is less.  
1) Standard  age-height-weight  corelation  tables  should  be  consulted  while prescribing the minimum weight limits so that these may be in accord with the height limits that may be adopted by the different States/Union Territories. 
5) **Physical Efficiency Tests** 
70. No physical tests are prescribed in a number of States; even where prescribed, they vary from State to State. In Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the one-star standard of the National  Physical  Efficiency  Test  is  the  qualifying  test.  The  need  for  standard physical efficiency tests has been stressed by the Assam, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal Police Commissions. The aim should be to provide physical efficiency  tests  which  are  easy  to  administer  to  large  numbers  of  candidates  and which do not require specialised equipment or previous specialised training. Keeping these requirements in view, the one-star standard of the National Physical Efficiency Test should serve as a model for the physical efficiency test for the recruitment of Constables. 
6) **Selection Procedure** 
71. Constables are recruited at present on a district/battalion basis and there is no standard  procedure.  In  Delhi,  recruitment  is  made  by  a  board  consisting  of  three officers  of  the  rank  of  Superintendent  of  Police,  the  Senior  Psychologist  and  the Educational Adviser. In the States, the Superintendent of Police or even a Deputy Superintendent is entrusted with this work. Recruitment is generally made as and when vacancies occur. 

    71\.1 The Bihar Police Commission had recommended the appointment of a Police Service Commission on the lines of the Railway Service Commission for recruitment to the lower ranks of the police. Their view was that the selection of Constables should  be  held  centrally  on  a  range  basis.  The  Tamil  Nadu  Police  Commission recommended a qualifying examination by the Public Service Commission and final selection  by  a  Committee  comprising  of  the  Superintendent  of  Police  and  two gazetted officers. The Uttar Pradesh Police Commission suggested that the Range Deputy Inspector General and the local Superintendent of Police should constitute the selection  board.  The  West  Bengal  Police  Commission  recommended  a  Police Recruitment Board consisting of the Principal of the Training College, who is an officer of the rank of Deputy Inspector General, and a Commandant of the armed police.  We  agree  with  the  view  that  there  are  main  advantages  in  recruiting Constables locally and that their recruitment cannot be centralised on account of the large numbers involved. The procedure for the recruitment of Constables should not be cumbersome. It should, however, ensure a uniform standard all over the State, the selection  of  the  best  and  the  most  suitable  material  available  and  objectivity  and impartiality. 

    **Acceptable Overall Standards, Norms and Procedures** 

72. Keeping the various considerations detailed above the following procedure for the recruitment of Constables should be adopted. 
1) Extensive publicity should be given  to the  recruitment  programme  in order to attract suitable candidates from all areas and all sections of the community in adequate numbers. 
1) The recruitment, both in the unarmed and the armed branches, should be made two  months  prior  to  the  commencement  of  the  course  in  the  police  training school/armed training centre. Since there will be more than one police training school depending on the size of the annual intake in a State, the courses may be staggered in the different schools so that recruitment is a continuous process and vacancies do not accumulate. 
1) Recruitment to the unarmed branch should be district-based and that to the armed branch  unit-based.  Since  the  qualifications  for  both  branches  are  the  same, recruitment to both may be made jointly. 
1) After  the  candidates  have  been  screened  with  regard  to  the  prescribed educational,  physical  and  age  qualifications,  a  physical  test  should  be administered to them on the model of the one-star National Physical Efficiency Test or any other tests prescribed in this regard by the State Police Organisation. 
1) Those who qualify in the physical test should be subjected to I.Q. tests. Candidates whose I.Q. rating is below a predetermined level should be dropped. 
1) The final selection may be made by a board consisting of the Superintendent of Police  of  the  district/the  Commandant  of  an  armed  battalion  and  two  other officers,  who  should  preferably  include  a  representative  of  the  police  training school. 
1) Selected  candidates  should  be  subjected  to  a  medical  examination.    Comprehensive instructions should be issued in every State for the guidance of the medical officers conducting this examination. 

(viii) The character and antecedents of the selected candidates may be adequately 

verified.  

**Chapter 5** 

**Recruitment of Sub-Inspectors and Subordinate Ranks** 

**Introduction** 

73. Sub-Inspector  of  police  is  an  important  and  vital  functionary  of  the  police orgnisation. He plays a key role in the overall functioning of the organisation in his various capacities. Most important of his role is that in the capacity of an SHO. The officer in charge of a police station popularly known as SHO, in fact, is the kingpin of all police actions and work whether preventive, detective and regulatory occuring in his jurisdiction. If the police station under his command functions properly, legally, constitutionally and honestly, the people will get an administration which is effective, efficient and responsive to their aspirations. It is the officer in charge of a police station who comes in continuous contact with the public and, while he works with the active co-operation and assistance of the staff under his control, it is he who shoulders all the responsibility and provides the leadership. 

    73\.1 Except in the bigger cities, the officer in charge of a police station is invariably a Sub-Inspector.   Any  weaknesses  in  him  can  have  serious  repercussions.  With   increasing consciousness among the people of their legal rights, the old, rough and ready methods can no longer be used in investigations and enquiries. A Sub-Inspector now has to be very well informed in the techniques of scientific investigation. His close  contact  with  the  public  is  an  important  link  in  the  chain  of  police  citizen relations and the image of the police depends largely on the  satisfaction  which  his  police  station   can  give  to  persons  approaching the police for help and on the judicious use of the discretion available to him. His attitude towards society should be up right  and  sympathetic  in  order  that  he  can  resist  the  temptation  to  indulge  in malpractices and withstand extraneous pressure in the performance of his duties. He should be sensitive to socio-economic and   political changes and be constantly aware of the fundamental rights of the people. He should be professionally competent and politically neutral, imbued with the spirit of service to the community and to the weaker  sections  of  society  in  particular,  and  above  all,  a  man  of  unquestionable character. 

    **Sub-Inspector’s Recruitment Contexts** 

74. In view of the expected special and specific physical, mental and professional requirements for suitable recruitment of the candidates for the post of Sub-Inspector, well- articulated and properly evolved standards, methods and norms are required to be developed with regard to effective and competent recruitment of Sub-Inspectors. Some of these standards and parameters can be the following. 
1) **Educational Qualifications** 
75. The minimum educational qualification prescribed for the recruitment of Sub- Inspectors  in  the  majority  of  the  States  is  a  graduate  degree.  All  posts  of  Sub Inspectors are filled by promotion from the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector for whom the minimum qualification prescribed is the Intermediate examination. A degree from a  recognized  university  has  been  recommended  as  the  minimum  educational qualification  by  the  Police  Commissions.  A  graduate  degree  from  a  recognized university should be the minimum educational qualification for the recruitment of Sub-Inspectors both the unarmed and the armed branches of the police. 
2) **Age Limits** 
76. The minimum age varies from eighteen to 21 years and the maximum from 23 to 25 years. Five years relaxation in age should be given to the scheduled castes/tribes candidates. Since a degree is normally obtained at the age of 19-20 years, we feel that the minimum age limit should be 20 years and the maximum 23 years.  
3) **Physical Qualifications and Measurements** 
77. The height prescribed varies from 162.5 cm (5'4") to 167.64 cm (5'6") and the deflated chest measurement from 78.74 cm (31") to 81.28 cm (32").  As a leader must have the same physical standards as those of his men, if not higher, the physical qualifications for Sub-Inspectors should be the same as recommended for Constables. 
4) **Procedure of Selection** 
78. Sub Inspectors are recruited centrally but the procedure varies from State to State. In Bihar and Kerala, recruitment is made through the Public Service Commission, in Haryana by the State Subordinate Services Selection Board and in Assam, Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir. Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat through a selection board on the basis of a written examination and an interview. In Andhra Pradesh, recruitment is made through a selection board but on the basis of  an interview only.  The  chairman  of the board  is  a  Deputy  Inspector General in Assam, Orissa, Rajasthan and Delhi. The Inspector General presides over the board in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. In Mysore, the chairman is the Secretary Home Department. Only Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh have prescribed intelligence tests. 

    **Recruitment and Selection Tests** 

79. Written tests were recommended by the Assam, Delhi, TamilNadu. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar  and  Punjab  Police  Commissions  and  also  by  the  working  group  of  the Administrative  Reforms  Commission  on  Police  Administration.  While  the  Uttar Pradesh Police Commission favoured a written test in general knowledge, psychology and Hindi, the Assam Police Commission recommended English essay and general knowledge as the subjects for the test. The Delhi Police Commission stated that the candidates should appear in the same test which is conducted by the Union Public Service Commission for the assistants of the Central Secretariat. The Tamil Nadu Police Commission recommended a combined competitive examination by the Public Service Commission for non-technical group II services and Sub-Inspectors. Physical efficiency  tests  were  recommended  by  the  Police  Commissions  of  Assam,  West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab. Departmental selection boards were recommended by the Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh Police  Commissions.  While  the  Bihar  Police  Commission  recommended  the constitution  of  a  Police  Service  Commission,  the  Punjab  Police  Commission suggested a board comprising of a retired General of the Army, the Inspector General of Police and the Educational Commissioner presided over by the chairman of the State Public Service Commission. The Uttar Pradesh Police Commission recommen- ded a board of two Deputy Inspectors General, a Commissioner and a non-official presided over by a member of the State Public Service Commission. The working 

    group  of  the  Administrative  Reforms  Commission  felt  that  recruitment  to  the ![](Aspose.Words.00a41c03-c990-408c-b25c-280b8db70daa.001.png)subordinate police ranks should be the full time responsibility of a single body in police  headquarters  comprising  "police  experts"  with  a  senior  Deputy  Inspector General as chairman, assisted by Commandants or Superintendents of Police and a Medical  Officer.  For  Sub-Inspectors,  one  more  Deputy  Inspector  General,  a personality testing officer and a psychologist could be added to the board. 

    **Special Tests** 

80. Certain tests should be conducted with the object of assessing the qualities of leadership,  courage,  initiative,  practical  intelligence  and  stamina  for  hard  and sustained physical work. The system adopted by the armed forces for the evaluation of these qualities through their Services Selection Centres can be adopted. These tests should  be  suitably  adapted  for  the  selection  of  Sub-Inspectors.  The  system  of recruitment to this rank should ensure objectivity and impartiality. 

    **Role of State Public Service Commission** 

81. The selection of Sub-Inspectors should be handed over to the State Public Service Commission. The detailed procedure may be as follows:— 
1) The physical efficiency tests may be organised by the Commission in districts through the agency of a board convened by the Superintendent of Police. 
1) Those qualifying in the tests should appear in a written competitive examination to be conducted by the Commission on the following pattern : — 



|S.No. |Subject |Duration |Maximum Marks |
| - | - | - | - |
|1 |Essay writing (In Engilsh, Hindi or Regional language) |One  & half hours |100 |
|2 |General  knowledge  (to  be answered  in  English,  Hindi  or regional language) Paper I |2 hours |100 |
|3 |<p>Current Affairs and History  Paper II  </p><p>Science and Geography </p>|2 hours |100 |

3) In addition to psychological tests, candidates should be subjected to a few simple 

aptitude tests, on the lines of those employed by the Services Selection Center, to be conducted by a selection board presided over by the Inspector General /Addl. Director General. The tests should carry a maximum 100 marks. The candidates should then be interviewed  by  a  selection  board  consisting  of  a  member  of  State  Public  Service Commission,  the  Inspector  General,  Superintendent  of  Police,  and  Psychologist. Candidates holding a degree or diploma in criminology may be given some weight in the interview. 

4) The marks obtained in the interview should be* added to those procured in the written  examination  and  in  the  aptitude  tests  for  drawing  up  the  merit  list.  The vacancies existing should be offered to candidates from this list strictly in order of merit. Suitable candidates can be earmarked from this list for appointment as Reserve Sub-Inspect and Platoon Commanders in armed police also. 
4) Candidates finally selected should be subjected to a thorough medical examination     and verification of antecedents. 

   **Certificate of Appointment** 

82. Every Police Officer of and below the grade of Inspector, shall, on appointment receive a certificate in the form provided for this purpose in the respective Police Act. 

    **General Conditions** 

83. The following, are some of the general conditions of service for the subordinate ranks. 
1) Every  Police  Officer  shall  conform  himself  implicitly  to  all  rules  and orders which shall, from time to time, be made for the regulation and good order  of  the  service  and  cultivate  a  proper  regard  for  its  honour  and respectability.

**Subordinate Police Ranks** 

84. The subordinate Police Service ranks in State police organisations consist of the following ranks:- 
1) Police Inspector 
1) Sub-Inspector of Police 
1) Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police 
1) Head Constable 
1) Police Constable 

84\.1 The recruitment and promotion to the different ranks of the State subordinate Police Service are governed by the provisions of the Subordinate Police Service Rules of the respective State. Direct recruitment is made to the rank of Police Constable and Sub-Inspector while vacancies in other ranks in most of the States are filled up by promotion in accordance with the conditions stipulated in the rules. The method of appointment  through  direct  recruitment  or  promotion  is  detailed  in  the  respective service rules promulgated by the State govt. 

**Direct Recruitment** 

85. Direct  recruitment  for  the  ranks  of  Constables  or  SI  and  in  exceptional circumstances to other ranks like ASI or HC to civil or other branches of the police organisation  in  the  various  States  can  be  made  by  taking  recourse  to  one  of  the following methods. 
1) Recruitment by State Public Service Commission or by subordinate police service commission specific constitutes for this purpose. 
1) Recruitment Boards or Committees should be constituted specifically for each case. 
1) Recruitment  with  the  involvement  and  cooperation  of  the  Employment Exchange. 
1. At  present  different  States  take  recourse  to  recruitment  through  State  Police Service Commission for  recruitment  of  Su-Inspectors and  Constables Recruitment Committees and Boards for the recruitment of Constables. In the light of new Police Acts being  adopted by the States, it will  be appropriate to constitute  Subordinate Police Service Recruitment Boards for upgrading the recruitment procedures and for making recruitments more systematic, efficient and quality oriented in the light of professional  demands  being  made  on  police  for  enthusing,  merit,  efficiency  and citizen service orientation in their working, performance and attitudes. 
1. As per the prevailing recruitment processes and procedures for the selection of Constables a Committee consisting of the Superintendent of Police of the District/Dy. Commissioner of Police, S.P. Railways as Chairman and D.C.P./Addl. S. P. of the District, Deputy Commissioner of Police/Addl. S.P. and a Dy.S.P. are nominated as members by the DGP. 

   **Calculation of Vacancies** 

86. The permanent or long term vacancies in the posts should be first classified by the Unit Officer as to whether they are to be filled by direct recruitment or by promotion as per the State Police Services Rules.  

    **Verification of Character  and  Antecedents**     

87. No person shall be appointed to any post in the Police Department, unless the appointing authority is satisfied that the candidates is of good character and is suitable in all respects for appointment to such post. The Government has issued instructions 

    for verification of  character and  antecedents  of candidates for appointment  to the 

    several  posts  in  Government  service.  The  procedure  laid  down  for  detailed verification should be strictly followed in respect of all the candidates.  

    **Medical  Examination** 

88. All recruits shall be sent to the medical board for medical examination, before issuing the appointment order. 
88. **Postings and Transfers of Junior Police Officers** 
1) The interest of Public service should be the only reason for transfers once in three years. Frequent transfers cause great personal inconvenience to the officers and result in considerable expenditure to the Government on account of payment of travelling allowance and other charges. 
1) Frequent transfers also dislocate administrative work and render it difficult to fix responsibility in  regard to in-ordinate delays and  other lapses  in the  discharge  of official duties. The authorities competent to transfer should bear these principles in mind while making such transfers. 
1) No member of the service shall be transferred within a period of two years except with the prior approval of the Government. 
1) No officer shall ordinarily be kept at the place without transfer for over three years.  
1) Transfers shall normally be made between the month of April and June every year. 
1) No travelling allowance shall be paid in the case of transfers made at the request of the officer concerned. 
1) No person shall normally be transferred outside the district in the case of district- wise posts and outside the range in the case of range-wise posts. 

   (viii) No member of the Police force (above the rank of constables) should normally be posted to his/her home towns or areas where he/she owns immovable property. 

9) Joining  time  maybe  granted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Rule. However, joining time cannot be claimed as a matter of right, and an officer may be directed to join the new post forthwith. 
10) When a Sub-Inspector/Inspector hands over the charge of a station, he shall give 

the relieving officer a charge list which shall contain details of property, registers and records  maintained  by  the  Station  House  Officer  and  also  a  memo  of  important matters to be attended to. While taking charge, the relieving officer shall check all the items of  property, records and  registers  mentioned  in  the  charge  list and  give  an acknowledgement to the relieved officer. If he finds any discrepancy or shortage in the items handed over to him, he shall make an entry to that effect in the Station House Diary besides submitting a special report to the Superintendent of Police of the district or an officer of equivalent rank in the case of other units. 

**Powers of Transfer** 

90. Subject to the conditions prescribed in the above orders, the powers of transfer of Police Officers are vested in the following officers : 
1) Ordinarily, no member of the service shall be transferred from one branch of the service to the other save as provided in the recruitment rules. 
1) Postings and transfers of Police Officers to specialised units like the C.I.D., Police Training School, and the State Intelligence shall be made in accordance with the Policy laid down by the Government and the Director General of Police in this behalf from time to time. 
1) The Superintendent of Police of the district including Railway Police District may  order  the  transfer  of  Police  Officers  of  and  below  the  rank  of  Sub- Inspectors of Police within his district.

92. **Deputation** 
1) The  Director  General  &  Inspector  General  of  Police  is  empowered  to  order deputation or extension of the period of deputation of officers of State sub-ordinate Police  Service  to  Central  Police  organisations  and  to  the  State  owned  industrial concerns  in  the  State.  The  Government  should  however  be  informed  of  such deputation.

**Chapter 8** 

**Police Training-An Overview** 

**Introduction** 

149\.  The  training  arrangements  in  the  different  States  need  to  be  improved qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The situation of general neglect and lack of genuine conviction towards the value of training needs to be immediately improved for brining about overall effectiveness and impact of police training. This naturally calls for a planning, developing and coordinating agency at the Centre as well as in the States. The problems of police training must be tackled and solved by the States at their own level. The Central Government will have to provide financial as well as technical assistance in the important task of reorganising training for the police at various levels. A good, well-organised training programme is only one of the several components, though an important one, which determine the efficiency and morale of an organisation.  

150\. **Training Concepts and Objectives** 

1) The  objectives  of  the  training  of  police  officers  should  be  the  inculcation  of knowledge and professional skills and the development of attitudes appropriate to their work and the people they come into contact with. Police training should, in addition, be given the necessary bias for science and technology. 
1) The training programmes must aim at providing a professional leadership which can help achieve the speedy transformation of an economically backward society into a  secular,  modern,  technologically  advanced  society  characterised  by  equal opportunity and social justice.  
1) Training should help to develop positive attitudes, acquire technical and analytical skills and encourage initiative and the ability to anticipate situations and innovate in order to achieve the goals of the organisation. It should create a sense of involvement and participation at all levels.  

   (v)  The  trainees  should  develop  an  enquiring  mind  receptive  to  new  ideas  and  a restless spirit which urges constantly to find ways of doing assigned tasks better and more efficiently and to keep away from cynicism and the line of least resistance. 

   151\. **In-Service Training** 

1) There should be a phased in-service training programme in the form of refresher, orientation, specialised, middle level and senior level courses, besides the induction training of new recruits at different levels to make training purposeful and effective for the attainment of the goals of the organisation. For the higher level officers, there should  be  a  greater  input  of  managerial  and  conceptual  skills  in  the  training programmes. 
1) In-service training courses should be linked with the channels of promotion to various  levels  of  higher  responsibility  to  ensure  better  motivation  and  greater effectiveness in the field. Persons who have undergone particular courses must be assigned to jobs where they can make use of the training imparted to them to ensure that they do not develop a cynical attitude to training which may infect others. It is desirable that individuals with promise should be selected for training as a part of their  career  development  so  that  they  can  contribute  their  maximum  to  the organisation and to society. 

   152\. **Effectiveness of Training** 

1) The effectiveness of training is determined by a combination of the trainee, the training  system,  in  which  the  trainer  plays  the  most  important  role,  and  the organisation to which the trainee will return. Any imbalance in this would offset the additional inputs given to the individual in terms of specific knowledge, skills and attitudes. 
1) Effective  training  and  positive  attitudes  of the trainees will not  guarantee, by themselves,  a  full  and  proper  utilisation  of  the  knowledge,  skills  and  attitudes imparted, if on returning from training, the trainee finds that his enthusiasm is not only not recognised but is even resisted and resented. Police officers at all levels must be so trained as to see themselves as persons who can offer help or counsel to those 

   below them and facilitate their growth. Such a realization at the senior levels would 

   result in creating the necessary climate to permit the junior officers to change their "behaviour" and make the organisation as a whole more effective for the fulfillment of its new role. 

3) The nature, level and content of the courses, the methods of instruction and the quality and quantum of the instructional staff will all need a periodic review with the object of constantly improving the training programmes. 
3) Training cannot neutralise unwise promotions or ineffective methods of work; nor can it replace intelligent supervision, favourable environmental conditions, individual willingness to accept responsibility, etc.  The effectiveness of training also depends on suck factors as motivation, morale in the organisation, opportunities for growth and fulfillment of aspirations, recognition of merit, etc. Training should be considered as an investment in human resources. 
3) It is necessary to induct new concepts into police training programmes, and to provide  training  material,  which  may  make  police  officers  aware  of  tremendous problems of the minorities and the under-privileged classes and the need to deal with them with an understanding of    the   factors    which    give    rise    to    particular situations. 
3) The  mental background of an officer is provided by a number of interacting factors, including his educational institutions. The officers of police training institu- tions must, therefore, set an example of behaviour, understanding and readiness to perform difficult tasks, which the trainees can emulate.  

   **Important Considerations** 

   153\. The following considerations deserve special emphasis in the training of the police:— 

1. Loyalty to the Constitution, commitment to the goals of the nation and the concepts of an egalitarian society, and the need for national integration 
1. Awareness of the problems that arise in the wake of the developmental process including conflicts, social disorganisation, scarcity and controls, regional imbalances etc... 
3. A deep social   awareness for   comprehending   and   reacting   to   complex situations 
3. Development,  of  analytical  and  innovative  skills  since  situations  will continue to change and no ready-made .solutions can be prescribed. 
3. A new orientation in dealing with the masses, who come from various strata of society, divided among many contours such as religion, caste, region and income, as may lead to the correct response in individual cases. 
3. The  need  for  the  application  of  scientific  techniques,  management concepts and skills, and constructive attitudes and values in police work. 

**Instructional Methods and Aids** 

154\. Every instructor should work out a plan of handling his subjects with a view to achieving the following objectives:— 

1. To impart the necessary knowledge regarding the subject. 
1. To assist the participants to develop the necessary skills for translating the knowledge into action 
1. To enable the participants to identify and understand the attitudes which would be desirable in handling different police situations. 
1) **The integrated or concentric method :** The integrated or concentric method of teaching should be adopted in all training programmes for developing in the trainees an understanding of the various aspects relating to the totality of a situation. In this method, all the aspects of a* theme are taken up together and the focus is on problem- solving rather than on memorizing various sections or texts. This will involve close cooperation between the various staff members lecturing on different aspects of the same theme and will also require a relatively higher ratio of staff to trainees than is the case  at  present.  The  effectiveness  of  integrated  teaching  can  be  enhanced  by supplementing the lectures with concurrent field exposure and other teaching methods and  using  modern  teaching  aids  so  as  to  ensure  the  maximum  possible  trainee participation  in  the  training  process.  Tutorials,  in  particular  provide  a  good opportunity to the instructor to help the trainees in developing the proper attitudes.** 
2) **The  teaching  of  management  concepts  and  techniques  :**  The  teaching  of management  concepts  and  techniques  is  facilitated  by  project  assignments, management games and exercises, practical, discussions, role play and case study in addition to lectures. For teaching the subject of human behaviour and attitudes, a series of panel discussions should be included for understanding critical social groups, conflict situations, the dilemmas faced by the police and the attitudes appropriate in facing them.** 
2) **The  guide  scheme  :**  The  guide  scheme  introduced  in  the  National  Police Academy  should  he  adopted  in  all  police  training  institutions  with  a  view  to developing the all-round personality of the trainees through self-analysis and self- development. 
2) **The modern teaching methods :** The various modern teaching methods in vogue at present in professional training institutions like lecture, demonstration, observation, discussion and its varieties, case study, role playing, simulation, sensitivity training, syndicate, in-basket, incident, brain-storming, problem oriented exercises and projects and  programmed  instruction  should  become  an  integral  part  of  police  training methodology.  The  levels  of  police  officers  for  whose  training  they  are  most appropriate  and  how  they  should  be  employed  so  as  to  make  police  training purposeful and effective should be part of the training process. 
2) **Use of scientific training aids :** A number of scientific training aids are available now which facilitate and enhance the effectiveness of the training/learning process. Not much use is being made of such aids in police training in the country at present. Several of them have been described in detail black-boards, display-boards, flannel- boards, training graphics, including models and cut-aways, films film strips slides, projectors and rape-recorders. It has also been indicated how they can and should be used to advantage in police training. 
2) **Use of films & audio-visual aids :** Frequent and regular use of films and audio- visual  aids  should  be  made  for  making  the  training  process  interesting  and sustainable.** 
7) **Training of police instructors & trainers :** The instructors in all police training institutions should be fully trained in instructional aids and methods. They should develop the ability to modify and adapt the various techniques and to identify which of them would be the most suitable for particular groups of trainees or for particular subjects or at particular stages of the trainees' career. In selecting a technique or a training aid, the instructor should be guided by the principles that the aid selected will help to deepen the trainees' insight into the subject under consideration, increase their abilities to analyse and solve problems, impart a more detailed and better integrated knowledge  of  the  subject  matter  and  stimulate  them  to  think  and  broaden  their interest. It should be accepted that their use will result in increasing the duration of training programmes. 
7) **Library facilities :** Adequate resources should be allotted for setting up a well- equipped library, with a documentation cell and micro-filming facilities in all police training institutions. These libraries have not only to acquire books and journals of police interest from the widest possible angle; they must also have a good deal of indigenous  material  relevant  to  the  Indian  context.  The  various  kinds  of  material required and how it should be built up has been indicated. In this connection, it is suggest that— 
1) the Central Directorate of Police Training should commission competent writers to prepare standard manuals and text books on police subjects;  
1) the instructors should prepare digests of important books and articles etc., and circulate the same to the students and each institution should have an electrically operated cyclostyling machine to facilitate the circulation of this material; 
1) the Central Directorate, of Police Training should get a number of model case  studies  and  role-play,  problem-oriented  and  simulation  exercises prepared with the help of experts for circulation to all Central and State training  institutions;  the  State  Inspectors  General/Deputy  Inspectors General, Training, should enlist the help of experts in the States to assist in preparing model case studies and exercises; there should be a Case Study Unit in the N.P.A. with staff properly qualified and trained in case study methods which would continuously obtain material both from the field and the trainees and suitably structure it for use in training programmes and similar work of collecting material and structuring case studies etc., should be taken up by the other Central and State institutions also; 
4) proceedings and summaries of seminars, symposia, panel discussions and talks by eminent visitors or guest speakers should be properly recorded so as to be available to teachers and trainees alike, records of discussions in earlier training programmes on specific subjects, group discussions as well as  the  recommendations  of  the  trainees  and  observations  during discussions should forma part of the teaching material for future courses; 
4) the preparation of books on instructional methods should be taken up by the Training of Trainers Wing of the National Police Academy; and 
4) all this material should be classified and indexed for ready reference by teachers/trainees  and  the  Central  Directorate  of  Police  Training  should help  in  the  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  bibliography  and  the exchange/circulation  of  new  material  as  it  is  produced  in  the  different training institutions. 
9) **Training Material :** Since there is uniform pattern of police training throughout the country, the methodology and to a large extent the training material should also he uniform. The Central Directorate of Police Training should co-ordinate the efforts at the Centre and in the States and assist the State Inspectors General/Deputy Inspectors General, Training and the heads of the State training institutions with advice and guidance in this work.  
9) **Training evaluation :** Sophisticated  methods for evaluating the usefulness of training methods, techniques and aids should be evolved by the Central Directorate of Police Training in due course. 

   **The Instructional Staff** 

   155\. The present position with regard to the instructional staff of the police training institutions is quite discouraging. This is due to a lack of adequate interest in training matters  on  the  part of the  authorities  and the posts  of instructors  not having  any attraction per se. A change in this situation is most urgent and pressing and it needs to be recognised that the instructor plays the role of a change agent in the organisation. 

   155\.1 In order to attract the host talent for the instructional staff, it should he ensured that  postings  to  the  training  institutions  are  not  made  a  matter  of  convenience. Suitable Officers properly selected, should he kept in view for such postings so that they may he considered a matter of pride.  

   155\.2 Teaching assignments at training institutions should be for a fixed duration. There should be planned turn over of the staff and a constant infusion of new blood. The normal tenure of the instructional staff should be for three years which may be extended to five years in the cases of officers found eminently suitable. An officer posted to a training institution should be allowed to do his full term even if his promo- tion  accrues  in  the  meantime.  This  could  be  done  by  giving  him  the  benefit  of promotion by temporarily upgrading the post held by him. 

   155\.3 In order that posting to training institution is desired and not shunned as at present, steps should be taken to provide adequate incentives. The instructional staff should be entitled to rent free accommodation, special pay and/or rank promotion, schooling facilities for children, and recognition by way of promotion, good postings and rewards. Since rank promotion would-be more attractive to the subordinate ranks than special pay, officers who are in the approved lists for promotion should he given accelerated promotion and posted to training institutions. 

   155\.4 The guide scheme which aims at   moulding correct attitudes and behaviour, requires the instructors and the trainees to have informal contacts and discussions.  Adequate facilities should be provided to the instructional staff to enable them to invite and entertain the trainees at their residences. 

   155\.5 The instructional staff of the training institutions should be encouraged to visit similar  institutions  in  other  States  for  promoting  better  understanding  and advancement of knowledge and skills by interaction with colleagues. 

   155\.6 An instructor should have adequate professional knowledge and experience of the subject which he is to teach, along with sincerity and enthusiasm for the job. For the  young  and  impressionable  trainees,  the  instructor's  devotion  to  duty  and  en- thusiasm should be catching. A good teacher must have a well-balanced personality and an even disposition. His bearing and appearance should display abundant self- confidence and vitality. Only then he will have the force of character sufficient to mould the character and attitudes of the trainees who come to the training institution as adults. 

   155\.7 The heads of the police training institutions should be on the look out in every course for officers with instructional aptitude and potential and suitable entries should be made in the annual confidential rolls of officers considered likely to make good instructors. Simultaneously, applications should he invited from officers for posts on the instructional staff and the best persons should be selected out of those who vo- lunteer through interviews. 

   155\.8 The  officers  selected should be  given  a  strong  theoretical  grounding in  the philosophy       of education, the various sociological factors which have a bearing on the  educational  attainment  of  individuals  and  the  psychological  elements  which explain an individual's perception and motivation towards learning before they are assigned to instructional work. They will need also to develop effective leadership abilities and the skills essential in the art of teaching. They should be conversant with the various methods of instruction. In order to enable them to make effective use of there methods and audio-visual aids, they should be provided with opportunities to be come proficient in their use. It is essential for instructors to learn to evaluate the performance and attitudes and values of their trainees, which will also enable them to know how effective or otherwise their instruction has proved to be. The instructors should  also  have  a  good  knowledge  of  the  organisation  and  administration  of  a training institution in all its aspects.  

   155\.9 The instructors should be exposed to management training to enable them to see the need for change, to grasp new developments quickly, to retain themselves when necessary and to develop creativity, sound judgment and planning. 

   **Feed-back and Follow-up Mechanism** 

   156\. All training programmes must have a system of evaluation of instructors. The trainer should evolve a method of receiving feed back from his trainees and, wherever possible, an assessment from his colleagues.  He should  also have the  capacity to evaluate his own performance by judging the reactions of his trainees and through the results of the various tests held by him from time to time. The head of the institution, who would be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the several instructors, should discuss with each the subjects to be taught by him, the preparation he has made, the methodology he proposes to adopt and the integration of instructional aids in the teaching process that he has planned. 

   156\.1 The senior officers must display faith and belief in and extend their whole- hearted support to the process of training in order to make the job of the instructor effective and rewarding. 

**Chapter 9** 

**Training of Constables** 

**Introduction** 

157\. The Constable is the most frequently seen police officer and the first to come in contact with the people, who expect him to use his authority for safeguarding their rights and rendering them assistance in the solution of their problems. His powers of arrest though limited, give him much scope for the use of his authority. His trailing should concentrate on imparting professional skills and developing his abilities and attitudes in such a way as will enable him to discharge his functions effectively. He has  to  deal  with  individuals  as  well  as  groups  of  people.  The  one  aspect  which deserves  the  maximum  attention  in  his  training,  therefore,  is  his  behaviour  and attitude towards the common man. He must be physically fit and fully trained in unarmed combat.  

**The Basic Training Course for Constables** 

158\. The newly recruited persons on the rank of constables should be sent to undergo a nine months basic and foundational training course to be conducted by police/recruit training schools. A model syllabus for this training course has been prepared by the Gore Committee, which is reproduced below. The State Police Organisations may make suitable changes, amendments and incorporate modifications in the proposed syllabus as per their professional needs, demands and requirements.

160\. Examinations and/or tests should be conducted from time to time throughout the course. The first examination may be held three months after the beginning of the course. Apart from these examinations and periodical tests, which could be either oval or written, there should be practical exercises to test the trainees' skills. 

The guide scheme should be introduced in the police training schools also. A group of about fifteen recruits should be attached to each instructor, who would guide them in their studies and also develop informal contacts with them with a view to evaluating their  attitudes  and  correcting  them,  whenever  necessary.  In  respect  of  the  other trainees also, each instructor should keep a record of any incident which comes to his personal notice in the class-room or outside. Twice a year, at the middle and again at the end of the session, all the instructors should meet in a conference to be presided over by the head of the institution. They should discuss the attitudes and behaviour of each trainee, make a final assessment and give the Commandant's marks. These marks should be added to the marks obtained in the written and practical examinations and other tests for the final grading. 

160\.1 The physical fitness programme should be conducted in the morning. All other outdoor training could be conducted in the afternoon. In view of the importance of night work for the police the entire training programme for a particular day may be conducted at night once a   month. 

**Practical Training of Constables**  

161\. A system of practical training of Constables should be introduced in all States. It should be for duration of sir months as detailed below.  

161\.1 **First Month** -Attachment to a police station to learn routine duties, such as sentry, escort and picked. Special attention should be given to the maintenance of the duty roster, the general diary and other police station n cords and returns, the accounts work of the police station, including the preparation of T.A. Bills and the use of the Police and Criminal Intelligence Gazettes. The Constables should attend the morning parades and kit inspection and acquire knowledge about local criminals. 

161\.2 **Second and Third Months**—Special attention should be given to preventive work, such as patrolling, beat duty, surveillance and Naka Bandi by day and night. The need for developing police-public relations, helping persons in need and dealing with juveniles with sympathy should be emphasised. Training should be given  in developing contacts in haunts of bad characters, gambling dens and brothels for the collection of criminal intelligence. Memory and observation training should be given in order to develop the capacity to detect wanted or habitual criminals from their descriptive rolls or photographs. 

161\.3  **Fourth  Month**  —The  Constables  should  be  required  to  accompany investigating officers to learn duties relating to the preservation of scenes of crimes, searches, seizures, arrests and raids. They should be told how criminal record at the police station and in the M.O.B. is used for the detection of crime and the location of criminals. 

161\.4 **Fifth und Sixth Months**—Attachment to an urban police station for being made familiar with problems of urban policing with particular stress on duties relating to  beat,  and  law  and  order.  The  Constables  should  be  acquainted,  under  close supervision,  with  the  management  of  different  types  of  peaceful  crowds  first  and thereafter with the handling of mobs and unlawful assemblies requiring the use of force. The need for tact, courtesy, patience and restraint should be stressed. 

161\.5 There should be emphasis on night work and the training should include an attachment to social service institutions, wherever they exist, for about two hours a week. The proper maintenance of an observation note book should be made a regular habit with  every  Constable. This  training  can  be best  conducted  at  medium-sized police stations, which combine some urban and some rural areas and are also the headquarters of the Circle Inspectors. It should be the responsibility of a specially selected  and well-motivated Sub-Inspector known  for his  integrity and  efficiency, who  might,  if  necessary,  be  an  additional  officer,  depending  on  the  number  of Constables to be trained. The Sub-Inspector in-charge of the training should submit monthly progress reports on each trainee Constable to the Deputy Superintendent, Training. At the end of the practical training the Deputy Superintendent Training, should  personally  examine  each  Constable,  and  submit  a  report  to  the  Inspector General/Deputy  Inspector  General,  Training,  pointing  out  the  favourable characteristics and the defects, to enable the latter to decide whether the services of any Constables should be dispensed with or whether the period of probation should be extended in the cases of those reported upon adversely. 

161\.6 During the first few years of their service, Constables of the civil police should not be posted to the reserve, lines where they would either form part of the reserve or perform mechanical duties. They should spend the first three years in police stations so that they can acquire proficiency through experience of field work. In order to give them an incentive to learn their work intelligently and to perform it efficiently, they should  be  allowed  to  take  the  examination  for  promotion  to  the  rank  of  Head Constable during this period. Career planning should make it possible for a* deserving Constable to earn promotion by the time he has put in about five years service. 

**Refresher Course for Constables** 

162\. A refresher course of four weeks duration should be compulsory for Constables at intervals of seven years in order to maintain their professional efficiency and to ensure that they maintain the attitudes desirable in police officers. To be effective this training must be imparted in the police training schools according to the syllabus detailed by the Gore Committee on police training as per the following details. The course should be utilised to identify promising Constables for being encouraged to work their way up. Constables who have completed 25 years of service or 50 years of age, those who have a persistently unsatisfactory record of service, and Constables who have done a promotion course or have been approved for promotion need not be sent for refresher training.

164\.1 Constables should be encouraged to avail of correspondence courses and/or evening classes for improving their educational qualifications to the extent this can he done without detriment to their duties. It would facilitate this process if Government bears the charges on account of the fees for these courses. To provide the necessary motivation, suitable allowances may lie sanctioned in the form of advance increments to Constables who pass the High .School or higher examination. 

**Chapter 10** 

**Training of Sub-Inspectors** 

**Introduction** 

165\. A Sub-Inspector has to control and supervise the staff under him to ensure that they perform their duties effectively and to the satisfaction of the people. He must have training in supervision and leadership, an adequate knowledge of social defence and  faith  in  the  preventive  aspects  of  police  work.  He  must  have  a  thorough knowledge of the laws and his legal obligations and be fully aware of the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed to the citizens as also of the laws relating to social reconstruction and their implications for the progress of society towards its goals. He must be thoroughly trained in the techniques of investigation and the application of scientific  aids  and  the  way  in  which  crimes,  which  are  heinous  or  of  grave consequence  to  society  can  be  prevented  or  detected.  The  various  aspects  of  the maintenance of order require very thorough attention, in this training. He is expected to be intelligence oriented so that he can anticipate events. Since he has to work often under gravely provocative situations, he must have a good insight into the behaviourly patterns of various groups in society and the mental equipment required to Heal with law and order problems with foresight, presence of mind and patience. He has to learn to  deal  with  the  delicate  problems  of  security  and  must  be  trained  in  the  special features of urban policing. He must also have the ability to tackle dangerous criminals.  

165\.1 Based on these considerations, a syllabus for the basic course of Sub-Inspectors of twelve months duration has been framed by the Gore Committee on police training which may be adopted by all State Police Organisation along with their contemporary professional needs and requirements.

**Chapter **121****

**Training of Senior Police Officers** 

**Foundational Training of IPS Probationers** 

181\.  The  I.P.S.  probationers  undergo  the  foundational  course  at  the  Lal  Bahadur Shastri  Academy  of  Administration.  The  opportunity  of  living  and  working  with officers of the other services helps to foster a spirit of understanding and cooperation. 

**Perspectives on Training of IPS Probationers** 

182\.  The  I.P.S.  probationers,  who  are  the  potential  leaders  of  the  force,  must  be equipped with all such professional knowledge, skills and attitudes as will not only prepare  them  for  the  effective  performance  of  their  tasks  but  also  for  higher responsibilities. They should have an understanding of the socio-economic changes going on in the country and their thinking should be in tune with the national goals and value systems and the urges and aspirations of the people.  

182\.1 Based on these considerations, the probationers' course was restructured by the Gore Committee on police training. The revised curriculum for the training of IPS probationers is outlined below:

**The Physical Fitness Programme**  

184\. The physical fitness programme for the IPS probationers should be following. **Theoretical Training (fifteen periods) :** 

185\. About fifteen indoor periods would be necessary to indoctrinate the probationers into the why and how of physical health. The physiological effect of different types of physical exercises on the human body will be explained. Scientific analysis of suitable diet will be communicated to them. Even tips (regarding first aid to keep physically fit will be given to them. 

**JOGGING (Thrice a week) :** 

186\. Running or jogging will be done thrice a week at the beginning of the P.T. period. The running should be about for half a mile to one mile. Up to 25 years of age one mile run should need about seven minutes, up to 35 years about eight minutes. Thus this running can be finished within the first ten minutes of the P.T. period. On the  other  days  on-the-spot  running  should  be  done  for  five  minutes.  If  a  step  is counted on the left foot, about 400 to 450 steps should be completed in this on-the- spot running. In the Indian system of Asanas this is called 'Eksthanpalayanasana'. On- the-spot running for three to five minutes for all age is recommended before each meal for keeping fit. 

**BREATH CONTROL of DYNAMIC BREATHING—(Every-day):** 

187\. After the running or, if for any reason, it is not done, at the commencement of the  P.T.,  breath  control  or  deep  breathing  should  be  done  without  hurry  and systematically. This breathing can be done from the sitting posture called 'Siddhasana' or it can be done while standing in a relaxed manner. This systematic deep breathing may  be  done  for  five  minutes  (or  for  prescribed  number  of  times  which  can  be increased according to practice) each morning and last thing each evening.  

**SURYANAMASKARS—(Every-day) :** 

188\. Every morning 20-25 Suryanamaskars which require about less than ten minutes should be performed.  These suryanamaskars must be performed every day and as part of Mass P.T. also. 

**YOGASANAS—(Thrice a week) :** 

189\. Simple Yogasanas will be performed twice a week in the P.T. period. After running, the following Asanas will be performed :— (a) Padmasana. (b) Sarvangasana. (c) Halasana. (d) Bhujangasana. (e) Salabhasana (f) Dhanursana (g) Pascimotthasana. (h) Matsyasana. (i) Viparitakarani. (j) Shavasana (deep relaxation) (k) Yogamudra 

**Body Building And Development Without Equipment :** 

190\. (This should be done on holidays   (Twice a week),  also privately for 20-30 minutes). A. The most important and basic exercises are: 

1. Press-up  
1. Knees bend (Squat)                                                  
1. Sit-ups  
1. Calf raise 
1. Neck exercises 
1. Wrist exercises 
1. Feet exercises 
1. Arms exercises 
1. Abdominal and back muscles exercises 

**Body Building and Development with Equipment**  

191\. Concurrent field exposure is an essential part of the instructional technique in order  to  establish  a  link  between  the  theory  and  reality.  Study-cum-cultural  tour cannot be converted into a part of the programme of concurrent field exposure, the probationers should be taken to fewer places and more time should be provided in their programme to study the problems relating to the subjects on which they have been given instruction. 

**Practical Training** 

192\. Practical training should be related to instructions received in the institution and the latter must take note of the field conditions and seek to provide practical answers to real life problems. There should be due emphasis on night work during practical field training. The probationers should go back to the N.P.A. for a mouth to round off this  training.  The  post-N.P.A.  training  of  I.P.S.  officers  should  be  conducted according  to  the  programme  detailed  by  the  Gore  Committee,  which  is  detailed below: 

**Integral or Sandwich Pattern of Training** 

193\. ***Programme of Post-N.P.A. Training*** 

1) First & Second Months—State police training college or I.G.P's office to learn local laws and languages. 
1) Third Mouth—Training in police stations (rural and urban).  
1) Fourth Month—Station house officer.  
1) Fifth  Month—Attachment  to  Circle  Inspector/Sub  Divisional  Police Officer.  
1) Sixth Month—Attachment to prosecution branch.   
1) Seventh, Eighth & Ninth Months—Attachment to district police office and district H.Q.                                                            
1) Tenth Month—Attachment to crime branch, State C.I.D./intelligence branch.        
1) Eleventh Month—(i) First two weeks at H.Q. of armed police battalion.       

(ii)* Second two weeks— miscellaneous non-police 

officers. 

**Integrated Teaching & Training** 

194\. The best system for the training of I.P.S. officers is the method of integrated teaching linked with concurrent, field exposure to be followed by practical training in 

the States for eleven months and a final rounding off at the Academy for one month. 

194\.1  If  the  concurrent  field  exposure  cannot  be  arranged  because  of  the  non- availability of facilities in the vicinity of the Academy, the alternative would be a sandwich pattern of training. Outdoor training will go on during both periods at the Academy and the institutional and post-institutional training will have to be split up and inter-woven. The splitting up of the institutional and the practical training, each into two parts, as envisaged in the sandwich pattern of training, will not be conducive to  the  training  programme  as  a  whole  to  achieving  its  objectives  in  an  effective manner  which  is  so  necessary  for  successful  police  work  in  the  present  difficult, times.  

**The Daily Training Schedule of NPA** 

195\. The daily schedule of training at the N.PA. should be revised as follows:— 0630—0700—Physical fitness programme. 

0900—1300—Class-room work. 

1500—1640—Language studies. 

1600—1830—Parade and games. 

2030—2200—Self-study. 

195\.1 In view of the addition of important subjects to the syllabus, like the Role of the Police  in  Modern  India,  Management  Concepts  and  Techniques  and  Human Behaviour and Police Attitudes, which are considered essential to meet the present- day requirements and the increasing responsibilities of the future, the use of more effective  instructional  methods  which,  by  themselves,  demand  more  time  and  the requirements  of  guest-lecturers,  concurrent  field  training,  etc.,  the  total  period  of training of I.P.S. probationers at the N.P.A. may be extended to fifteen months. 

195\.2 In order to ensure that trainees are developing properly a system of evaluation, which can serve as the basis of further improvements in teaching as well as learning, should be introduced. It should be continuous, comprehensive enough to cover both the academic and non-academic areas, and related to the objectives of the training programme. Formal evaluation, through written examinations in theoretical subjects and practical tests in outdoor work, should be accompanied by an informal evaluation through  question  and  answer  sessions  in  the  class-room,  group  discussions,  role playing and other problem oriented exercises, tutorials, etc. 

**Evaluation of Training** 

196\. For the evaluation of practical work and personal and social qualities, various items should be listed and rating scales for their evaluation developed. Some methods of evaluation could be on the basis of following rating scales. 

**Rating Scales** 

1. **Discipline**

196\.1 The development of the attitudes desirable in police officers is an important objective of the present training programme. "Pending research into effective ways of assessing attitudes, this should be attempted through observation of how the trainees behave in different situations by all the teachers, who should  maintain a personal record  for  each  trainee.  It  may  be  possible  to  develop  rating  scales  for  desirable attitudes also. The final assessment may be made at a joint meeting of all the teachers. Among the attitude on which special emphasis may be laid are integrity, impartiality ![](Aspose.Words.00a41c03-c990-408c-b25c-280b8db70daa.004.png)and sympathy towards the weaker sections of the people.

1) A regional language, shown in column 2 of the Third Schedule against the State to which he got allotted. Where more than one regional language is shown against a State,  the  Director,  N.P.A.,  should  ascertain  whether  the  probationer  was  already familiar  with  any  of  them  and  thereafter  decide  in  consultation  with  the  State Government  in  which  one  of  the  regional  languages  the  probationer  should  be examined.

Personnel in the armed police must not only be efficient in the use of their weapons  and  equipment  and  the  performance  of  their  duties,  but  also  physically tough, disciplined and capable of working in a team. Since they are being increasingly deployed  on  duties  which  bring  them  into  intimate  contact  with  the  public,  their training must be enlarged to impart a proper understanding of their role in relation to the  people.  The  officers  in  the  armed  police  must  be  capable  of  motivating  the personnel under their command to work with a spirit of service, be capable of tackling problems  with  competence  and  assurance  and  with  a  proper  understanding  and appreciation of the situation to be faced.

**Specialized Course** 

215\. The following specialist courses should be arranged—

1. Tear-smoke  
1. Anti-dacoity operations 
1. Counter-insurgency and anti-extremist operations. 

**Evaluation of Training** 

217\. The system of evaluation for the armed police should be the same as for the corresponding ranks of the civil police. The trainee should, in addition, be assessed regularly on his performance in the handling of weapons and equipment and in the deployment  and  management  of  personnel.  A  general  impression  note  should  be maintained by the instructors in respect of each trainee. The general impression notes should be discussed and the Commandant's marks should be awarded in a conference of the instructors with tin, head of the Institution towards the end of the course. These marks should be added to the marks obtained in the written and other tests for final grading. 

217\.1  The  integrated  method  of  teaching  should  be  used  wherever  possible.  The maximum use should be made of audio-visual aids, including sand model discussions, tactical exercises without troops and outdoor exercises. 

217\.2 There should be a regular physical training programme intended to make the personnel tough. Their daily schedule of training should begin with physical training in the  morning and the indoor classes should be held when the trainees are least fatigued, i.e.,* in the forenoon. Outdoor work like weapon training, tactical exercises and other practical work can be done during any time of the day. 

**Chapter 13** 

**Organisation of Training** 

**The Basic Structure** 

218\. There should be three kinds of institutions in the States for the training of police officers— 

1. A  police  training  college  for  the  training  of  Deputy Superintendents/Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors. 
1. One or more police training schools for the training of Constables and Head Constables. 
1. An armed police training centre for the training of personnel of the armed police battalions.  

**Course to be run by Police Training Colleges** 

219\. The police training colleges in the States should run the following courses— 

1. Basic course for directly recruited Sub-Inspectors—one year.  
1. Refresher courses for Sub-Inspectors and Inspectors—eight to ten week. 
1. Courses  on  crowd  control  for  Sub-Inspectors,  Inspectors  and  Deputy Superintendents—six to eight weeks. 
1. Courses on the investigation of fraud, embezzlement, organised rackets and  economic  offences  for  Sub-Inspectors,  Inspectors  and  Deputy Superintendents —six to eight weeks. 
1. Courses on the role of the police in dealing with juvenile delinquency for Sub- Inspectors, Inspectors and Deputy Superintendents-  four weeks. 
1. Courses  on  police-community  relations  for  Sub-Inspectors,  Inspectors and Deputy Superintendents— two weeks, 
1. Courses  for  Head  Constables/Assist  ant  Sub-Inspectors  selected  for promotion to the rank of Sub-Inspector—six months for Head Constables and three months for Assistant Sub-Inspectors. 

viii.  Course  for  Sub-Inspectors  selected  for  promotion  to  the  rank  of 

Inspector— six to eight weeks. 

9. Basic course for Assistant Police Prosecutors—six months. 
9. Refresher course for Assistant Police Prosecutors—six to eight weeks.  
9. Basic course for directly recruited Deputy Superintendents—one year. 
9. Refresher course for Deputy Superintendents—eight weeks. 

xiii.  Course  for  Inspectors  selected  for  promotion  to  the  rank  of  Deputy 

Superintendent— ten weeks. 

**Assessment of Training Workload** 

220\. The exact workload of each police training college should be worked out by the State concerned on the basis of the present sanctioned strength of its police force and the plans, if any, for expansion in the near future. The existing facilities should be expanded and new colleges set up as necessary in the different States. 

**Course to be run by Police Training Schools** 

221\. The police training schools of the State should run the following courses:—  

1. Basic course for recruit Constables—nine months.  
1. Refresher course for Constables—one month.  
1. Refresher course for Head Constables/ Assist ant Sub-Inspectors—eight weeks. 
1. Course for Constables selected for promotion to the rank of Head Constable— six months. 
1. Course for Head Constables selected for promotion to the rank of Assistant Sub- Inspector—three months. 

222\. The size of the constabulary is very large in some of the bigger States. A police training school with a capacity of 400 appears be the most viable.  The States and Union Territories may examine this matter in the light of their actual requirements and expand the existing schools or set up new ones as necessary to organise  the training of Constables and Head Constables as recommended by us. 

**Course to be run by Armed Police Training Centers** 

223\.  The  armed  police  training  centers  of  the  States  should  run  the  following courses— 

1) Basic course for recruit Constables—nine months.  
2) Basic course for directly recruited Sub-Inspectors—nine months. 
2) Re-orientation  courses  for  civil  police  personnel  transferred  to  the  armed police—four months. 
2) Course  for  Constables  selected  for  promotion  to  the  rank  of  Head Constables—fourteen-fifteen weeks. 
2) Course  for  Head  Constables  selected  for  promotion  to  the  rank  of  Sub- Inspector—fourteen-fifteen weeks. 
2) Course for Sub-Inspectors selected for promotion to the rank of Inspector— fourteen-fifteen weeks. 
2) Refresher course for Sub-Inspectors—fourteen weeks.  
2) Refresher course for Inspectors—fifteen weeks. 

223\.1 All States which have a large enough strength of armed police battalions should have a separate training institution for this purpose. If the facilities at this Centre prove  inadequate  for  the  training  of  recruits,  a  State  may  convert  one  or  more battalions into training battalions, solely for this purpose. The States, which have only a few armed police battalions, may group together to have an armed police training centre for which staff and finances could be provided jointly. In the alternative the States falling in the latter category could start an armed wing at their police training college/school. 

**Centre to set-up Training Units** 

224\. The Central Government should set up at least one police training college and one police training school for States and Union Territories where the annual intake as well  as the total  complement  of  the  police force  is small  and  where independent institutions may not be feasible. The central police training college and school can serve as models for the States. 

**Location of Training Institution** 

225\. A police training institution should be located in or near a city with a university and well connected by rail, road and air communications to facilitate external contacts 

and well connected by rail, road and air communications contacts and to ensure that 

the trainees can be exposed to real-life problems during their training and that there is a ready availability of scholars and guest lecturers for imparting instruction in the social and behavioural sciences, current affairs, etc. 

**Buildings, Infra-Structure and Facilities** 

226\. Most of the police training institutions have been accommodated in an ad hoc* fashion  in  buildings  constructed  for  altogether  different  purposes,  e.g.,  old  forts, temporary army lines, etc. The maintenance of the existing buildings also leaves much room for improvement. Many of them have no regular class room facilities; most have no auditorium or a meeting hall: and a large number do not provide any common room facilities for the instructional staff. In some even the head has no separate office of his own. Barrack and hostel accommodation and such essentials as toilets, baths, messes  and  dining  rooms  for  the  trainees  are  woefully  inadequate.  The  library facilities arc meager and often accommodated in make-shift arrangements. Canteen facilities are generally lacking. The furniture provided, even for class rooms is mostly insufficient and unsuitable and at many places the trainees bear either wholly or partly the cost of the cooking utensils of their messes and pay for the services of washer men and cobblers as also for electricity. Recreational facilities need improvement; some institutions do not have adequate playgrounds; swimming pools have boon provided in very few and most lack hospital facilities. A very small number provide residential accommodation for all the instructional staff. 

**Improvement and Enhancement of the Facilities** 

227\. The question of providing all essential physical facilities in the police training institutions should receive urgent consideration in the States. The lay-out and the design of the buildings should make adequate provision for the administrative offices, assembly  hall  and  class-rooms,  a  library  and  reading  room,  a  gymnasium,  a swimming pool, garages, canteen, married accommodation for the instructional staff and single accommodation for the trainees, with adequate toilets, bath rooms, cook houses and dining rooms, extensive grounds for parades and games and facilities for various forms of recreation and artistic and cultural activities. Every police training institution  should  have  a  hospital  for  the  treatment  of  all  minor  ailments,  with arrangements for specialist treatment in the city hospitals as and when necessary. The 

members of the families of the instructional staff should be eligible for treatment in 

these hospitals. The campus as a whole should permit the development and growth of a healthy corporate life in the institution. Furniture, fixtures and fittings should be adequate to ensure a reasonable degree of comfort and should facilitate the use of modern  aids to  instruction.  Sub-Inspector  trainees  should  be  provided with  hostel accommodation  in  single  or  double  seated  rooms.  Barrack  accommodation  will suffice for recruit Constables, but each recruit should get a cot to himself and at least a wooden rack or a table to keep his essential belongings and reading material for study. In all training courses, the trainees should be required to pay only for their food and  all  other  institutional  and  establishment  expenses  should  be  borne  by Government. The Government of India should evolve and lay down a standard blue- print and aid the States with suitable building grants for the above purpose. 

**Forensic Lab** 

228\. Every police training college should have a miniature laboratory with sufficient equipment to enable demonstrations to be given in various items of forensic work.   In the bigger States one regional laboratory should be established in the town where the police training college is located. 

**Model Police Station** 

229\. Every police training college/school should have a model police station, which   should  have  a  complete  set  of  the  forms  and  registers  used  in  police  stations preferably duplicated from entries in the records of an actual police station.  It should also have the case diaries and judgments of a sufficient number of cases which may help to give a practical bias to theoretical training. 

**Workshop** 

230\. A small workshop with skilled personnel should form a part of every   police training institution to develop and prepare audio-visual aids and repair and maintain equipment. 

**Training Grant** 

231\. Every police training institution should be given an annual training grant of Rs. 20,000 in addition to funds under specified items. The head of the institution should be  empowered  to  spend  the  same  at  his  discretion  for  miscellaneous  expenditure   with regard to training   programmes and aids. 

231\.1  The  head  of  a  State  police  training  college  should  be  a  Deputy  Inspector General or an Inspector General in the bigger States and a Senior Superintendent of Police of the selection grade elsewhere. The Police training school should be headed by an officer of the rank of Superintendent of Police. A Deputy Commandant of the rank of Superintendent of Police and an Adjutant (Deputy Superintendent) should be placed in exclusive charge of the armed police training centre. Where, armed wings arc set up in police training colleges, an officer of the rank of Commandant, but junior in service to the Principal, should supervise all the work of the armed wing. 

**Upgrading the Staffing Pattern** 

232\. The existing staffing   pattern of police training institutions should be upgraded and indoor instructors in the   police training colleges and schools should not be below the rank of Deputy Superintendent and Inspector respectively. 

**Setting -up the Various Department** 

233\. Every police training institution should have a department of legal studies, a department of police science and a department of social sciences. In the police training college, the legal studies department should be headed by a senior Police Prosecutor, that of police administration by a Superintendent or senior Deputy Superintendent and that of social sciences by a sociologist, psychologist or criminologist of the grade of Reader in a university. The heads of these departments may be one rank lower in the police training schools/armed training centres. All the teaching of law in the various courses to be run at the college/school should be systematically organised by the legal studies  department  and  the  two  other  departments  should  likewise  organise  the teaching of all subjects relating to police organisation and administration, etc., and general education respectively, A departmental organisation will ensure constant inter- communication within the staff and a pooling of feed back from the trainees. 

**Composition of Indoor Classes** 

234\. Ordinarily, an indoor class should not consist of more than 30 trainees in the case of the lecture method and fifteen trainees in the case of syndicates and tutorials.  The staff requirements of the three departments may be worked out on this basis. 

**Arrangements of Guest Lectures** 

235\. It will be necessary to invite guest lecturers to deliver talks on some subjects.  The  institution  should  bear  their  travelling  expenses  und  it  should  be  within  the powers of the heads of the training institutions to pay an honoraria to guest lecturers at the rate of at least Rs.** Five hundred per lecture. 

**Outdoor Training Composition** 

236\. The outdoor instructors should not be below the rank of Head Constable and some of those in the police training college should ho of the rank of Sub-Inspector.  There should be one instructor for every 20 trainees in drill and musketry and one for every 40 in physical training.   Every institution should have a 'demonstration squad'   and a firing range. 

**Research Base and Orientation** 

237\. In order that the police training institutions remain intellectually vibrant and up- to- date in their knowledge of police problems etc., research should be one of their basic-functions. While fundamental research may be undertaken by the Central and State Police research units, the training institution should undertake .some applied research through its instructional staff. Every institution should have a separate cell under a competent instructor for this purpose. These cells should confine themselves to problems in the training field for which satisfactory answers have yet to be found and which have been enumerated in the body of the report. This research work should be undertaken under the guidance of the Inspector General/Deputy Inspector General, Training, and in coordination with the Central Directorate of Police Training. 

**Training Schools for Special Wings and Branches** 

238\.  Each  State  should  have  a  well  organised  training  school  for  officers  of  the special/intelligence branch. Model syllabi for the courses required should be drawn up and the instructors trained by the Intelligence Bureau. 

**Motivation for Training to Participants** 

239\. In order to motivate officers to attend courses, we recommend as follows—  

1. An officer deputed to a course, whose duration does not exceed three months, should not be liable to transfer. This would not apply to officers deputed to courses, the successful conclusion of which is accompanied by rank promotion. 
1. Officers  deputed  to  courses  should  be  entitled  to  a  compensatory allowance to enable them to meet their incidental and other expenses. 
1. The  courses  that  an  officer  has  attended  and  his  performance  therein should be taken fully into account in all selections for promotion. 
1. The  selection  of  officers  for  attending  courses  should  be  related  to considerations of career planning, the merits of the various officers in the field of selection and their qualifications and experience from the point of view of their capacity to benefit from the proposed course. 
1. Constables passing refresher or specialist courses should also be entitled to wear a stripe on their arms to distinguish them from those who have not attended any such course. 

**Enhancement of Supervisory Level** 

240\. In each of the bigger States, a senior officer of the rank of Addl. DGP/Inspector General  should  be  appointed  to  devote  whole  time  attention  to  important  matters relating to personnel administration like recruitment, training, career development and promotion,  and  the  management  and  supervision  of  the  institutional  and  practical training of police officers of all ranks. There should be a separate officer for the post of Principal of the police training college. 

240\.1 The Inspector General, Training, should be provided with a Superintendent, Training, as an assistant at his headquarters and a number of Deputy Superintendents, Training, in the field either on a range basis or by groups of districts, to supervise the practical  training  of  Sub-Inspectors  and  Constables.  This  arrangement  should  riot minimise in any way the involvement of the District Superintendent in the practical training of the officers concerned. 

**Better Finance & Funds for Training** 

241\. The States should find more money for police training to improve the existing arrangements.  A major financial investment will also have to be made by the Central Government if police training is to be reoriented and modernised throughout   the country. 

**Training of Trainers** 

242\. The Police Academy (NPA/State Academy) should have a Training of Trainers' Wing and a Case Study Unit. The number of courses to be run will also increase in the future. All these activities for the training of senior- police officers cannot be carried on effectively in any institution located in an inaccessible place and away from any university or other institutions of learning The Academy draws officers from all parts of  the  country  and  the  respective  State.  It  should  be  a  reservoir  of  up-to-date professional knowledge, promote effective instruction, a community of outlook and objectives, a team spirit, ideals of national integration and public service and be a source of inspiration to its alumni.  

243\. **Basic and Important Parameters** 

1. The  work  of  the  apex  Academy  should  be  organised  into  four departments as follows— 
   1) Department of Legal Studies. 
   1) Department of Police   Science. 
   1) Department of   Social   Sciences. 
   1) Department of Research,   Development and    Information. 
2. The professional background and qualifications requisite in the heads of the different departments and the staff pattern of each department should be worked out by the Director of the Academy in consultation with the Central Directorate of Police Training and experts in universities and other  institutions  of  learning.  Adequate  supporting  staff  should  be provided to attend to the management, welfare and other work of the institution. 

**Central Detective Training Schools** 

244\. More Central Detective Training Schools should be opened on a regional basis. In  addition  to  the  existing  Schools  new  Schools  may  be  started  at  appropriate locations to serve the needs of various States/Union Territories. The capacity of the existing Schools may be increased to the extent possible without prejudice to the quality of the instruction provided there. 

**Training of the Instructional Staff** 

245\. There are no arrangements in the country at present for the training of the instruc- tional  staff  of  police  training  institutions.  Their  number  will  increase  with  the reorientation of the existing institutions and the setting up of new ones. The Central Government should aim at setting up an Institute for the Training of Trainers, when the requisite expertise has been developed. Instructors so trained can be utilised to train  instructors  of  lower  ranks  in  the  States  by  establishing  similar  or  analogous training programmes in their own police training institutions. 

**Courses for the Outdoor Instructors** 

246\. The States should send selected outdoor instructors to the following courses regularly:— 

1. Courses  on  counter-insurgency  and  anti-extremist  operations, anti-dacoity operations and weapon training conducted at the Central School of Weapons and Tactics, Indore. 
1. Course on unarmed combat conducted at the Central Reserve Police Training College, Neemuch. 

**Courses at Different Training Schools** 

247\. A new course for training instructors in the new physical fitness programme should be started at the Police Training college, Nasik. Course for drill instructors should  be  organised  and  run  by  the  Armed  Training  Centre,  Sitapur.  Central programmes for-"training instructors on tear smoke should be started at the Police Training Colleges at Phillaur and Vellore. 

**Role of Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science** 

248\. The Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science should develop new courses in techniques of management, personnel management and leadership, application of computer technology to police work and social defence for I.P.S. officers, organise a series of symposia and seminars on various aspects of police work with a view to maintaining a constant dialogue between police officers and various other sections of public  opinion  and  start  a  system  of  fellowships  to  encourage  interested  police officers to undertake research work on a whole-time basis. The Institute might be affiliated  to  a  university  for  this  purpose.  The  courses  on  management  could  be arranged in the existing institutes of management till the Institute of Criminology and Forensic Science is in a position to undertake them. 

**Traffic Training** 

249\. Traffic problems are becoming more and more complex and difficult, in the urban as well as the rural areas. These problems will necessitate a rapid increase in the strength of the traffic police and will call for specialised training to be imparted to the higher ranks in the latest techniques of traffic policing. At present there is Traffic Institute in Bombay and a Traffic Training School in Calcutta. The Government of India  should  take  urgent  steps  to  set  up  a  Central  Traffic  Institute  for  imparting training to officers from the rank of Sub-Inspector or Sergeant to Superintendent of Police at a suitable place, preferably Delhi, where the Central Road Research Institute is located. More institutions of this kind will be necessary later on at places like Calcutta, Bombay and Madras. 

**Facilities to All Training Institutions** 

250\. The State and central police training institutions should be provided with all essential physical facilities including arrangements for the board and lodging of the officers attending courses in these institutions.  

It will be indispensable for the success of the scheme of the training of police officers that there should be a Central co-ordinating unit at the Centre There is no machinery at present which can devote full attention to this work. There is also no arrangement for  any  periodic  evaluation  of   the  functioning  of  the  training  system.  A  Central Directorate  of  police  Training  is  an  important  and  urgent,  need.  The  Directorate should be located in the Bureau of Police Research and   Development   at Delhi as an integral part of the Ministry of Home Affairs. 

**Collaborative Mechanism for Police Training** 

251\. There should be collaborative arrangements between police training institutions and universities and other appropriate institutions for undertaking research projects on matters  of  interest  to  the  police  and  training  programmes  designed  to  meet  the requirements of police officers at various levels. These will help to establish a channel of  communication  between  the  police  and  the  academic  world,  capitalise  on knowledge  and the  skills developed  in other  institutions  and universities, develop training material and make the public a ware of the work being done by the police, thereby improving police community relations and the police may police image. 

**Chapter 14** 

**Performance Appraisal** 

**Introduction** 

252\.  People  differ  in  their  abilities  and  aptitudes.  It  is  necessary  to  know  these differences so that certain programmes may be developed for those who possess better potentials to accept the challenges of higher jobs. Programmes may also be developed for rectifying the deficiencies of the employees. Every organisation therefore, likes to appraise its personnel and their performance. The system of appraising the man is not new, but the systematic approach of evaluating the man is a new development.  

**The Techniques** 

253\. The technique of appraising the man by superiors or others is widely known as merit rating. It is also sometimes, termed as 'employees appraisal' 'personnel rating', 'personnel appraisal' and 'personnel performance evaluation' etc. 

**Merit Rating : The Concept** 

254\. Performance appraisal, personnel rating, merit rating or performance evaluation is  one  of  the  most  important  functions  of  personnel  management.  Merit  rating technique has been evolved to know the relative worth of the employee quantitatively and qualitatively on the job, in comparison to other fellow workers. Merit rating is used for measuring the merit or performance of an employee and comparing it with that of others in the same group. Merit rating rates the man and not the job. It is concerned with assessing the abilities of the individuals. Job evaluation rates the jobs in order to determine their worth. Job evaluation is used as a basis of wage structure while merit rating is used as the basis of sound personnel policy in relation to transfer, promotion  etc.  The  process  of  merit  rating  starts  at  the  time  of  recruitment  and continues throughout the life of an employee in the organization. 

**The purpose** 

255\. The following factors or qualities should be considered for making evaluation of the performance of the employees. 

- Ability and capacity to do the assigned work 
- Skills  and  capabilities,  i.e.,  knowledge  of  various  jobs  and  various operations 
- Personal qualities of the employee and his work habits like dependability, cooperation etc 
- Quantity and quality of output 
- Supervisory qualities 

**The Steps and the Procedure** 

256\. The steps necessary for designing an effective  merit rating programme are : Determining  objectives,  establishing  the  standards  of  performance,  selection  of appraiser,  collection  of  data,  rating  the  employee,  consultation,  designing  the development and follow up. 

**Essentials of a good Appraisal System** 

257\. Following are the essentials of a good appraisal system : 

- It must be easily understandable. 
- It must have the support of all line people. 
- It should fit the organisation's operations and structure. 
- The system should be both valid and reliable. 
- It should have built in incentive. 
- The system should be periodically evaluated. 

**Criteria of Performance Appraisal** 

258\. There are a number of criteria which can be used to appraise the performance of different classes of employees in an organisation. Some of the important criteria are : Production, quality of work, length of service, training, ratings of supervisors. 

**Methods of Performance Appraisal** 

259\.  The  performance  of  employee  may  be  appraised  by  a  number  of  ways  and methods. Two basic types of performance appraisal used are : 

1. Appraisal according to his traits, attributes and general behaviour on the job i.e., trait approach 
1. Appraisal of result, work and goal achievement of the employee known as appraisal by result 

**Common Appraisal Factors** 

260\.  Basic  elements  common  to  most  result  oriented  appraisals  should  be  the following : 

1. The superior and each of his subordinates jointly plan the subordinate's tasks and responsibilities. 
1. The subordinate prepares a plan for specified period, say six months, or a year. Through mutual consultation, the final target to be achieved is fixed. 
1. Through mutual consultation, they also fix up and clarify superior's supporting and evaluative role. 
1. At  the  end  of  the  specified  period,  the  superior  makes  a  performance evaluation of the subordinate on the basis of mutually agreed criteria. 
1. Superior  discusses  the  results  and  his  evaluation  with  the  subordinate. Corrective  actions,  if  necessary,  are  suggested,  and  mutually  agreed  upon targets are fixed for future. 
1. The  method  emphasized  traits  and  other  characteristics,  focusing  on performance results. 

**Success Parameters** 

261\. The success of a good appraisal system depends on the following factors. 

1. Good  job  descriptions    specifying  areas  in  which  goals  are  to  be   developed 
1. Trust in the subordinate to establish responsible goals 
1. Specification of specific rather than general goals 
1. Problem solving rather than criteria discussion of ensuring performance 

**Barriers to Performance Appraisal** 

262\. Among the principal barriers to effective appraisal programmes are following : 

- Faulty assumptions 
- Psychological block and 
- Technical pitfalls 

**Modern Methods of Performance Appraisal** 

263\.  Most  traditional  methods  emphasise  either  on  the  task  or  the  worker's personality. In order to bring about a balance between these two, following modern methods have been developed: 

1. Assessment centre methods 
1. Human asset accounting method 
1. Behaviourally anchored rating scales 
1. Management by objectives 

**Management by Objectives (MBO)**  

264\. Management by objectives approach is designed to overcome the limitations of the more traditional system. This is a result oriented appraisal. The approach of merit rating is based on the quantitative measurable performance goals often agreed jointly by superior and subordinates. Instead of asking the superior to rate his subordinates under this approach, each subordinate is requested to set for himself short-term goals by which he may improve his own efficiency and that of his department. 

**Features of MBO** 

265\.  Main  features  of  MBO  are  superior  subordinate  interactions,  superior  and subordinate mutually set goals, superior and subordinate mutually set performance criteria, progress evaluation, superior's supportive role and the focused method. 

**Performance Appraisal in Police** 

266\.  Performance  appraisal  is  one  of  the  accredited  modes  of  judging,  gauging, scaling and monitoring the quality and standard of work execution by an employee. Human resources development and performance appraisal are interrelated processes. Their mutuality supplements and supports the specific and collective objectives of an organization. 

Performance appraisal as operational reality can provide a continuous and holistic manifestation to various organizational attempts to develop, stabilize and modify the potentials of policemen of different ranks.  

**Basic Considerations** 

267\.  Performance  appraisal  is  one  of  the  oldest  management  tools  for  work assessment. Being universal in nature, it is also the widely accepted tool for assessing the quantity, quality and standard of the human resources available and utilized by the working  personnel  of  an  organization.  As  an  efficient  supervisory  and  control mechanism it tends to evaluate both the personality traits and performance potentials of employees. 

267\.1 Performance appraisal as a managerial style aims at the systematic evaluation of an individual's standard of performance. It also screens the potentials which require further  development.  Such  an  assessment  is  ordinarily  made  by  the  immediate supervisor of an employee. A further review is made by the next supervisor. Though there  are  minor  modifications  in  this  mode  of  performance  appraisal  from organization to organization yet the general pattern of assessment by the immediate senior and a review by the next superior is the most common and widely accepted mode of performance appraisal in all organizations. The police organization is no exception to this general rule. 

267\.2 Performance appraisal has been accepted as a valid and objective tool for the evaluation of work standards. It is also widely used as a valid tool for the modification of working standards and as an instrument for HRD. Performance appraisal, in order to  be  an  efficient  tool  for  personnel  growth,  should  represent  impartiality  and objectivity in its nature and content. Operationally, it should be in consonance with the organizational philosophy and its objectives. An impartial and objective system of performance appraisal can give relevance and equilibrium to input-output efforts at goal attainment. Such a system alone can create faith in the employees. It can then provide vision, feedback and follow-up for the ideal functioning of an organization. 267.3  Performance  appraisal  evaluates  the  existing  performance  potentials  of  an employee and tends to work as a pointer for his possible further growth. It thus has contemporary as well as futuristic relevance for managers and men. 

**The Stages** 

268\. The various aspects of performance appraisal can be staggered into different stages. Some of the important ones can be the following. : 

1. Identification of organizational objectives 
1. Familiarization of the employees with the objectives 
1. Identification   of tools, techniques and   work equipment for the attainment of goals 
1. Assessment of the working conditions 
1. Specification of   targets to be   achieved   during a given period of time 
1. Intermittent and terminal assessment of the performance of each employee 
1. Self-appraisal of his performance by the employee 
1. An objective, critical and unbiased assessment along with adequate guidelines to improve performance. 
1. Modification and improvement efforts by the employee. 
1. Final assessment and the setting of new goals for the next year. 

**Anatomy and Morphology**  

269\. The quality of PA in the police organization is in no way better or worse than the one available in most of the governmental departments. The standard mode of PA is filling in ACRs or APAs at the end of a year. The ACR forms and performance appraisal performs in police and  those applicable to the rest of the employees of various  governmental  services  are  common.  The  existing  performance  appraisal techniques  intend  to  do  an  evaluation  of  the  personality  traits  of  the  policeman concerned.  Such  an  evaluation  is  often  subjective  in  nature  and  tends  to  depend largely on the personal whims, eccentricities, likes and dislikes of the assessing office. The secrecy syndrome shrouding the system makes the situation still worse.  

**Shortcomings & Drawbacks** 

270\. Some of the defects and drawbacks of the existing PA system in the police organization are the following : 

1. The PA system is stereotyped, orthodox and traditional in nature. 
1. No specific and efficient modes of appraising the performance of each policeman in his particular position are available. 
1. The system tends to be tainted by subjective and personal considerations. 
1. There is lack of clarity as objectives and goals for each man and each rank are often not spelled out properly and in advance. 

5     There  is  often  only  one  assessment  at  the  end  of  the  year  and  the  junior 

subordinate  hardly  gets  an  opportunity  to  reform  or  improve  himself  in  the absence of intermittent evaluation of his performance. 

6. The system is unduly secretive in nature. 
6. The system  lacks  adequate  communication  between  seniors  and juniors  with reference to performance objectives and working conditions, 
6. The system of PA is monotonous, dull and routine. 

**The Bottle Necks** 

271\.  Some  of  the  elements  which  work  at  cross-purposes  in  the  system  of performance appraisal in police could be the following: 

1. Policemen of all ranks often remain overburdened with routine and unpredictable workload;  hence  they  find  it  difficult  to  maintain  the  requisite  quality  in  job performance. 
1. The senior officers have neither time nor scientific tools to control the quality of their subordinate's job performance. 
1. Each and every task performed by the junior subordinates does not get subjected to a critical test. 
1. It  is  often  felt  that  SHOs  lack  the  qualities  of  becoming  efficient  leaders  and therefore they can neither control nor guide their suborainates properly on various matters pertaining to their job performance. Consequently, the significant aspects of PA suffer from some sort of cruel negligence. 
1. In  a  nutshell,  the  much  awaited  development  of  human  potentials  in  police personnel as part of organizational development suffers from a vigorous loss of 

   time and energy because of the defective PA system in police. 

272\. **A  Stratification** 

1) **Performance appraisal** as an efficient mode for judging the quality of police socialization in entrants should be vigorously used by training schools. Police training schools should devise various input-output control and modification mechanisms to ensure that the requisite conversion of new recruits as efficient policemen for the field takes  place  in  the  desired  manner.  The  performance  appraisal  styles  of  training schools should concentrate on the following parameters: 
   1. Physical aspects 
   1. Mental development 
   1. Professional evaluation 
   1. Instillation of police skill and job enlightenment 
   1. Qualities to manage and face crises 
1) **Physical  Fitness  :**  The  physical  fitness,  strength  and  stamina  of  each  trainee should be judged on the basis of the standard he achieves in self-defence and assault styles. Physical appearance, muscular development and increase in physical fitness over the period of training can be worked out mathematically by charts and graphs showing the target achievement and the progressive development/deterioration. The quality and standard of performance of each trainee can be classified into categories A, B, C and D according to his individual performance and target achievement. A trainee obtaining a particular category should be guided to achieve a higher category. Response,  drive  and  initiative  exhibited  in  achieving  the  given  goals  should  be carefully  recorded.  While  sending  the  performance  appraisal  of  a  trainee  to  the appointing authority, his strong and weak points should be discussed in detail. A short guideline should also be given to the appointing authority as to how best and where the new employee can be utilised. 
1) **Foundational Courses:** Foundational and basic recruit courses are designed to expose  entrants  to  the  basic  role  of  and  general  information  about  the  police organization.  Mentally  and  professionally  the  trainees  have  to  take  off  from introductory preliminaries about the organization and ultimately, at the close of a course, they are made to explore the organizational realities in detail. The progress made by the trainee has to be subjected to a critical scrutiny in order to work out the impact of training on him. Desired attitudinal change and instillation of police skills for rendering the trainee an efficient and competent policeman also form part of a basic training course. The performance of the trainee should be analysed in order to inform him of the type of progress he has been making during the course of his training. Such analysis can measure the overall utility of training efforts. 
4) **Refresher & Specialized Courses :** Refresher, advanced and specialized training courses  should  be  worked  out  keeping  in  mind  the  specific  objectives  which  are aimed to be achieved through these training efforts. The performance appraisal of these courses should be based on the following parameters : 
1. Educational and professional profiles of each trainee should be made available to the training schools. 
1. The participation, involvement and willingness of a trainee in the various training activities and his aptitude for and attitude towards the training should be observed minutely. 
1. Self-appraisal of his performance should be obtained from each trainee. 
1. The contribution of each trainee to the execution of the course, along with his initiative,  participation  and  involvement  in  the  training,  should  be  recorded regularly. 
1. Assessment  of  the  "entry"  and  "terminal"  behaviour  of  each  trainee  should  be recorded. 
1. Gradation  of  performance  at  the  training  school  should  become  part  of  career planning and promotional prospects. 
1. Trainees who obtain A and B grades in the course should be suitably rewarded and their role, contribution and participation in the course should be made an integral part of their annual performance appraisal. 

273\. **Performance Appraisal in the field** 

(i) Performance appraisal, in order to be an effective parameter for assessing the work performance of employees and for the efficient development of human resources has to be properly utilized not only at the training level but also at the level of field functioning. The system of performance appraisal in its form and application at the professional levels is presently too generalistic and unspecific, structurally as well as functionally. Performance appraisal, in order to be objective, impartial and specific, should be based on the targets given to each policeman by his superior. The popularly accepted style of PA is management by objectives. This should be made applicable to the policemen of all ranks. More weight should be given to the specification and allotment  of  concrete  targets  and  their  realization  and  the  provision  of  congenial working  conditions  and  functional  equipment  than  to  a  general  narration  and comment on personality traits and virtues. The performance appraisal system to be operationalized  on  policemen  of  various  ranks  should  be  based  on  the  following guidelines : 

1. The PA system must be task-oriented. 
1. Job and task profiles should be worked out in detail and each man should be given the job and task chart well in advance for the period for which his performance is to be assessed. 
1. The job and task charter should be specific, clear and rank-oriented. General police tasks having indirect bearing on his individual functioning should be given less weight compared to his primary tasks and responsibilities. 
1. The job and task charter can be divided into three categories : 
   1) Category  A  should  include  primary  and  basic  tasks  to  be  performed  by  an employee. 
   1) Category B should include the tasks which are expected to be performed with someone else or at the behest of some superior, junior or colleague. 
   1) In category C the tasks of general police functioning must be included. 
1. The tasks to be performed and the targets to be achieved should be neither too ambitious nor ambiguous. Along with the job chart, an information sheet about the mode of executing the given tasks, their how and why should also be given to the employee. The physical facilities, working conditions and performance equipment required for job performance should also be made part of this information sheet. 
1. Performance  appraisal  should  be  intermittent  and  terminal  in  nature.  A  self- appraisal report should be submitted by the employee at the expiry of a specified period. A critical assessment of the self-appraisal report should be made by the reporting  and  reviewing  officers.  The  positive  and  negative  points  of  the performance should be discussed at length, and on the basis of overall evaluation the  employee  should  be  categorised  as  **"outstanding"**,  "very  good",  "good", **"average"** or **"below average",** as the case may be An employee getting a lower ranking  should  be  provided  with  a  guideline  as  to  how  he  can  improve  his category. Each terminal appraisal should be seen in the context of the employee's previous performance. The subsequent and previous terminal performance reports should work as a continuous part of the assessment scheme, and at the end of the year a final report should be drawn. It should include a summary of all the terminal reports, and an elaborate assessment indicating the individual's potentials and the quality of his performance should be highlighted in unambiguous terms. 
7. The performance appraisal system in police must have a broad base. In addition to the  annual  reporting,  other  terminal  modes  of  PA  like  terminal  assessments, interviews etc should also be made part of the police performance appraisal.  
7. The appraisal of an employee's performance can be realistic and qualitative only when  the  reporting,  reviewing  and  other  officers  making  an  assessment  of  the employee have a close association with his functioning. These officers must have adequate, real and interactional opportunities and should keep watch, control, and supervision on the working of the employee reported upon. Only those officers who have a direct bearing on and relation with the working and functioning of the reported officer should be allowed to make assessment of his performance. 
7. In the existing system of performance   appraisal there are more than three officers who are to assess the performance of an officer.  There are no specific   guidelines as to what weight should be given to the assessment of each officer making an evaluation.  The closer the supervisory officer, the more should be the weight given to his assessment. The reporting officer should cite reasons for grading an officer outstanding, average or below average. If the reviewing officer or any other supervisory officer up to two ranks higher wants to tone down or tone up the remarks, he should be required to record specific and concrete reasons for doing so.  

**Instructions of Govt of India** 

274\. The Govt of India has issued some very important instructions regarding the mode and manner in which the performance of an officer should be evaluated. It would be pertinent to quote them here : 

1. The Confidential Report is an important document. It provides the basic and vital inputs  for  assessing  the  performance  of  an  officer  and  for  his/her  further advancement in his/ her career. The officer reported upon, the Reporting Authority and the Accepting Authority should, therefore, undertake the duty of filling out the form with a high sense of responsibility. 
1. Performance appraisal through   Confidential Reports should be used as a tool for human resource development. Reporting Officers should   realise that the objective is to develop an officer so that he/she realises his/her true potential.  It is not meant to be a   fault-finding process but a developmental one. The Reporting Officer and the  Reviewing  Officer  should  not  shy  away  from  reporting  shortcomings  in performance, attitudes or overall personality of the officer reported upon. 
1. The  columns  should  be  filled  with  due  care  and  attention  and  after  devoting adequate time. Any attempt to fill the report in a casual or superficial manner will be easily discernible to higher authorities. 
1. Performance evaluation by the Reporting Officer must not be done without having conducted at least one detailed inspection of the work of the subordinate unless the subordinate is one with whom his senior is inter-acting almost daily. 
1. If* the Reviewing Authority is satisfied that the Reporting Authority had made the report without due care and attention he shall record a remark to that effect.  
1. Every   answer shall be given in narrative form.    The space provided indicates the desired length of the answer.    Words and phrases should be chosen carefully and should accurately reflect the intention of the authority recording the answer. Please use   unambiguous   and   simple   language.  Please   do   not use omnibus expressions like   'outstanding', 'very good',   'average', 'below average' while giving your comments against any of the attributes. 
1. The  Reporting  Officer  shall,  in  the  beginning  of  the  year,  set quantitative/physical/financial targets in consultation with each of the officers with respect to whom he is required to report upon.    Performance appraisal should be a joint exercise between the   officer reported   upon and the   Reporting   Officer. The targets/goals/objectives be set at the commencement of the reporting year, i.e. April, in the case of the All India Service Officers. In the case of an officer taking up  a  new  assignment  in  the  course  of  the  reporting  year,  such targets/goals/objectives  shall  be  set  at  the  time  of  assumption  of  the  new assignment. 
8. The targets /objectives/goals should be clearly known and understood by both the officers concerned. While fixing the targets for achievement, priority should be assigned item-wise, taking into consideration the nature and the area of work and any special features that may be specific to the nature of the work of the officer to be reported upon. 
8. Although performance appraisal is a year-end exercise, in order that it may be a tool  for  human  resource  development,  the  Reporting  Officer  and  the  officer reported upon should meet during the course of the year at regular intervals to review the performance and to take necessary corrective steps. 
8. It should be the endeavour of each appraiser to present the truest possible picture of the appraisee in regard to his/her performance, conduct, behaviour and potential. 
8. Some posts of the same rank may be more exacting than others. The degree of stress and strain in any post may also vary from time to time. These facts should be borne in mind during appraisal and should be commented upon appropriately. 
8. Aspects  on  which  an  appraisee  is  to  be  evaluated  on  different  attributes  are delineated below each column. The appraiser should deal with these and other aspects relevant to the attributes. 

**Integrity Aspect of PA** 

275\. The following procedure should be followed in filling up the column relating to Integrity. 

1. If the officer's integrity is beyond doubt, it may be so stated. 
1. If there is any doubt or suspicion, the column should be left blank and action taken as under : 
1) A separate secret note would be recorded and followed up, a copy of the note should also be sent together with the confidential report to the next superior officer who will ensure that the follow up action is taken expeditiously. Where it is not possible either to certify the integrity or to record the secret note, the reporting officer should state either that he  had  not  watched  the  officer's  work  for  sufficient  time  to  forma definite judgment or that he has heard nothing against the officer, as the case may be. 
1) If, as a result of the follow up action, the doubts or suspicions are cleared, the officer's integrity should be certified and an entry made accordingly in the confidential report. 
1) If  the  doubts  or  suspicions  are  confirmed,  this  fact  should  also  be recorded and duly communicated to the officer concerned. 
1) If  as  a  result of  the follow  up action,  the doubts or  suspicions  are neither cleared nor confirmed, the officer's conduct should be watched for a further period and thereafter action taken as indicated at (b) and 

   (c) above. 

**Chapter 15** 

**Police Welfare and Grievance Redressal**  

**Introduction** 

276\.  A  Policeman’s  job  is  very  tough  and  arduous.  Long  hours  of  duty  and  the monotonous  nature  of  work  have  an  adverse  impact  on  this  health,  apart  from depriving him of normal comforts and consolations of family life. The policemen are exposed to both physical and  mental stress which takes a heavy toll, not only in respect of their health but also their behavior and conduct. The environment in which they have to work, the persons whom they come into contact and deal with, exposes them to many undesirable influences and temptations. The serious risk to life and bodily  injury  to which  the policemen are  exposed, on the call  of  duty,  make the families vulnerable and insecure. The rigours of discipline and restriction on them underline the need for a sound and effective welfare policy apart from a responsive grievance redressal mechanism. Several welfare schemes, mechanism for grievances redressal and sports facilities have been instituted for policemen and their families in the different police organisations. 

**Administration of Welfare Activities**        

277\. The Welfare Division of the DGP Office functions under the direct control of Addl. DGP/IGP (Welfare and Sports) who reports to DGP. IGP (Welfare and Sports) is assisted by an officer of the rank of DIG (Welfare & Sports) / AIGP (Welfare & Sports) in his day-to-day activities. 

277\.1 The welfare and other related activities for the police personnel and their family members are  carried out  under the  auspices  of units  like  Police  Welfare Society, Policemen's Family Welfare Society, and Police Employees Benevolent Fund. Police Health Care and Family Welfare Trust and Police Employees Welfare Association etc. DGP holds the ex-officio position of Chairman / President for various societies and committees. All the committees/ boards/ trusts/ associations/ societies at the state level consist of such members as prescribed by the rules and byelaws made for the purpose  in  respect  of  each  scheme.  These committees/boards/trusts/associations/societies conduct their business as per byelaws and rules framed thereunder. 

**Funds:** 

278\. Various funds are constituted which are managed professionally in accordance with  the  Rules,  and  such  executive  directions  as  issued  by  the  Management Committee from time to time. 

- Police Welfare Fund 
- Police Education Fund 
- Police Widow Fund                                                              
- Police Commemoration Day Flag Fund                                     

**Police Welfare Fund** 

279\. Police Welfare Fund is mainly funded by the periodical grants-in-aid received from the state government, as well as income generated from various sources which is accepted only with the permission of state government. 

**The Facilities** 

280\. The corpus of Welfare Fund is invested with various banks, financial institutions etc. in order to generate the maximum returns with security. The income so generated is used for extending interest free loans to the wards of non-gazetted police officers (i.e. of and below the rank of Inspector of Police and equivalent). Such loans are given for the marriage of daughter/son, self and dependent sister. The maximum limit of  marriage  loan  should  be  Rs.25,000/-  in  the  case  of  marriage  of  daughter; Rs.10,000/- for the marriage of son; Rs.7,500/- for self marriage and Rs.10,000/- for marriage of dependent sister. The loan sanctions should be in consonance with re- payment capacity of the individual officer. The loan will be recovered in appropriate installments.  Interest  free  loans  should  also  extended  for  meeting  any  emergent expenditure on any medical treatment. Such interest free medical loans to the extent of Rs.15,000/- may be given only if the officer or his dependent family members suffer  from  a  disease  of  a  grave  nature  and  reimbursement  facilities  are  not available/cannot be availed under the Government rules or any other scheme of the Department.  In  certain  grave  situations,  where  the  ailment  is  life-threatening  and 

urgent surgical intervention is necessary, interest free advances can extended, which should be paid in lump sum, on the receipt of reimbursement money by the officer. The medical loans are normally extended to the non-gazetted officers. However, in exceptional cases, medical advances may be given to other officers also. In rare case, where no other assistance is available medical grant not exceeding Rs.25,000/- may also  be  sanctioned.  Normally,  only  one  type  of  loan  is  sanctioned  at  a  time  and therefore no request is entertained for a loan in case there is an outstanding loan from any welfare scheme. 

**Unit Police Welfare Fund** 

281\. The districts/units may also maintain Unit Welfare Fund, Corpus for which is provided by the State Police Welfare Fund or from the income derived from other legitimate and authorised sources etc. The Superintendent of Police/Commandant or Unit  Officer  may sanction interest free  medical loan  upto Rs.5,000/- in  emergent cases. Such loan will be recovered in installments of Rs.500/-. The Unit Officers are required to submit detailed annual audited accounts to the office of the IGP (Welfare) as per orders in force. 

**Other Sanctions**

**Legal Assistance to Policeman** 

295\. Police officers will always be protected when it appears to the Government that they  have  acted  in  good  faith,  but  the  Government  will  not  bind  themselves  to undertake their defence when this is not the case. Legal proceedings in which the police officers are likely to be involved may be classified as follows : 

1) Proceedings, civil or criminal, instituted by Government in respect of matters connected with official duties or the position of a police officer ; 
1) Proceedings by a police officer against a private party or vice versa in respect of matters not connected with his official duty or position ; 
1) Proceedings by a private party against a police officer in respect of matters connected with his official duties or position ; 
1) Proceedings by a police officer to vindicate his official conduct when called upon by Government to do so ; and 
1) Proceedings instituted by a police officer suo moto to vindicate his conduct connected with his official duties or position with previous sanction of the Government though not required by Government to do so. 
1) In cases falling under (a) the Government will not give any assistance to a police officer for his defence In any proceedings, civil or criminal, instituted against him by the State in respect of matters arising out of or connected with his official duties or his official position. Should, however, the proceedings conclude in favour of the police officer, the Government will entertain his claim for reimbursement of costs incurred by  him  for  his  defence,  and  if  Government  are  satisfied  from  the  facts  and circumstances of the case that the police officer was subjected to the strain of the proceedings without proper justification, they will consider whether the whole or any reasonable proportion of the expenses incurred by the police officer for his defence should be reimbursed to him. 
1) In cases falling under (b), the government will not give any assistance to a police officer  or  reimburse  the  expenditure  incurred  by  him  in  the  conduct  of  the proceedings in respect of matters not arising out of or connected with, his official duties. 
1) In cases falling under (c), if the Government, on consideration of the facts and 

   circumstances  of  the  case,  considers  that  it  will  be  in the  public  interest that  the Government should themselves undertake the defence of the police officer in such proceedings and if the police officer agrees to such a course, the police officer should be  required  to  make  a  statement  in  writing,  as  in  the  form  below  this  order  and thereafter, the Government will make arrangements for the conduct of the proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted against Government- 

   **Civil Suits or Criminal Prosecutions Against Police Officers** 

   296\. In the case of a civil suit or criminal prosecution launched or threatened to be launched  against  a  police  officer  in  connection  with  the  discharge  of  his  official functions, the following procedure should be adopted : 

1) **Procedure to be Adopted When There is a Threat**  
1) A Police Officer who receives any communication containing a threat of civil or criminal proceedings against him for acts done in his official capacity should forward forthwith,  through  the  proper  channel,  a  copy  of  such  communication,  intimating whether  he  wishes  to  reply  thereto  or  not,  and  if  he  proposes  to  send  a  reply, submitting the proposed reply to his Unit officer. 
2) The Unit Officer who receives the communication along with the explanation should send the same with his observations to the Director General through the Range Inspector General, and the Director General will forward the same to the Government, i.e., Home Department. The Home Department will examine the draft reply and then send the same to the Law Department for their opinion and also for action, which will make the legal assistance available, if it is a fit case to be defended. 
2) The question of defending at the cost of the Government, a Police Officer who has received a communication containing a threat of legal proceedings need not ordinarily be taken up till the proceedings have been actually instituted. If, however, in criminal proceedings as well as civil proceedings the DGP considers that the proceedings are likely to be instituted against a Police Officer, he may examine the question as soon as he receives a copy of the communication from the concerned Officer. 
2) **Procedure When Civil   Proceedings are Launched** 
1) Whenever a civil suit or criminal proceedings is launched against a Police Officer, the Superintendent of Police or the Unit Officer will examine the following points before recommending legal assistance to the Government: 
1. Whether the suit has been filed within the period of limitation; 
1. Whether prior sanction of the Government has been obtained; 
1. Whether prior notice with sufficient description of the wrong complained of has been given  
1. Whether the legal requirements have been complied with 
2) If the suit has been instituted contrary to these provisions he will immediately direct the concerned subordinate Police Officer to request the court to dismiss it on these grounds. If, however, the provisions of the sections have been complied with then the Unit Officer shall forward the report to the Director General for further action regarding obtaining legal assistance. 

   297\. **General Instructions in Civil Suits and Criminal Prosecutions** 

1) If the Government sanctions the defence of an officer, it would ordinarily be sufficient to engage a Government Pleader or a Public Prosecutor at the expense of the State. In criminal cases in which a private counsel has to be engaged, a daily fee subject to a maximum for the whole case will be fixed by the Government. 
1) In civil suits also in which a private counsel has to be engaged, the Government will fix a daily fee subject to the maximum for the whole case.   In petty cases, appearance  in  person  may  be  often  quite  sufficient  and  where  this  is  so,  the employment of a pleader is superfluous. 
1) In cases falling under sub-orders (1) or (2) above, the fees payable will be settled and got approved by the Government prior to the engagement of the private counsel. 
1) The rate of fees payable to such counsel should not normally exceed the rates payable to Government Pleaders and Public Prosecutors fixed by the Government from time to time. Government, however, may fix higher rates of fees in cases of unusual  type,  where  marked  ability  and  industry  are  required  to  be  put  in  by  a Government Pleader or a Public Prosecutor. 

   **Stress on Police and its Management** 

   298\. Incidents of aggressive, undisciplined, indifferent, insensitive and irresponsive behaviour  and  conduct  by  policemen  are  attributed  to  the  stressful  situations  and working conditions which inevitably cause unwarranted stress to the police people working on various positions. Incidents of suicides, attempted suicides, and attack on seniors,  juniors  and  colleagues  coupled  with  unfortunate  incidents  of  firing  and senseless use of weapons are manifestations of stress on police. 

   **Components of Police Stress** 

   299\. The various studies  conducted  to examine  the  stress  situations of  policemen indicate that there is relationship between job stress and personality factors among police officers and constables. Components of job stress are physical factors, factors intrinsic to the job, role in the organization, relationship at work, career development, 

   organizational structure and climate, extra organizational sources of stress, personality and  behavioural  factors  along  with  mental  stagnation,  physical  and  psychological fatigue,  uni-directional  growth  of  personality,  dehumanizing  working  conditions, work overload, lack of proper training, professional and personal obligations, etc., etc. The researches prove that law enforcement personnel are at the upper end of the spectrum when stressful jobs are measured. Review of studies conducted in India reveal  that  crucial  problem  of  job  stress  in  policemen  arise  from  the  personal problems, the nature of police organization, the work environment and personality characteristics.  Keeping  in  view,  the  significance  of  job  stress,  it  has  become obligatory to analyze the underlying components and to scientifically assess the extent of job stress and its relation with personality factors among policemen in India along with evolving remedial measures to cope with stress situations of police profession. 

   **Specific Factors** 

   300\. The personality factors causing stress include among others factors like lack of empathy, ego-ideal, pessimism, introversion, neuroticism, lack of need achievement, lack  of  self  confidence,  dogmatism  and  dominance.  Further,  there  is  also  a  deep relationship of job stress and its components as well as personality and its attributes with personal and family background variables of policemen. The personal and family background variables are age, educational qualifications, present salary, number of jobs changed, total years of service, years of service in the present position, marital status,  size  of  the  family,  number  of  dependents, total  family income, number  of  children and native place of policemen etc. 

   **Realities Identified** 

   301\. Some of the important realities about police stress are listed below : 

1. There  is  difference  in  the  magnitude of perception  of  various factors  of stress and their contribution to overall stress situation 
1. Factors intrinsic to the job and relationships at work are the most dominant contributors towards stress. 
1. There is no particular trend in the hierarchical position of the job stress factors.  Rather,  a  remarkable  similarity  is  observed  in  the  perception  of various factors towards their contribution to overall stress. 
1. The factors of job stress are found to be truly different in nature. 
1. Relationships at work and factors intrinsic to the job have high positive 

   significant correlation with total job stress. 

6. Neuroticism  is  the  most  dominant  characteristic  of  a  policeman’s personality  followed  by  introversion.  Ego-ideal  is  an  attribute  having highest positive significant correlation with overall personality followed by neuroticism and need achievement. 
6. Pessimism  has  a  negative  significant  correlation  with  all  the  job  stress factors.  Department’s  pessimism  reveals  negative  significant  correlation with  factors  intrinsic  to  the  job,  relationships  at  work,  organizational structure, climate, personality and behavioural factors. 

viii.  Self-confidence  (lack  of)  reveals  negative  significant  correlation  with 

physical factors, factors intrinsic to the job, extra-organizational sources of stress and personality and behavioural factors. 

9. Overall  job  stress  has  negative  significant  correlation  with  pessimism, neuroticism and lack of self confidence.   
9. Personal  and  family  background  variables  play  a  significant  role  in perception of job stress by policemen. 
9. Age has a positive significant correlation with organization structure and climate and career development. 
9. Educational  qualifications  of  policemen  have  negative  significant correlation  with  physical  factors,  factors  intrinsic  to  the  job,  career development, personality and behavioural factors and total job stress. 

xiii.  Marital status has positive significant correlation with extra-organizational sources of stress of policemen. Size of the family of policemen has positive significant  correlation  with  total  job  stress  and  its  components.  Positive significant correlations are also revealed between number of dependents of policemen and total job stress and its components. Number of children of policemen show positive significant correlation with stresses arising from 

career* development and organizational structure and climate. Total family income has positive significant correlation with organizational structure and climate.  Native  place  of  policemen  is  found  to  have  no  significant relationship with the stress course or its components. Personal and family background variables have significant relationship with personality and its attributes. Age, present salary, total years of service, marital status, total family income and number of children of policemen reveals no relation with their personality or*  its attributes. Educational qualifications reveal negative significant correlation with ego-ideal of policemen. Number of jobs changed has  negative  significant  correlation  with  dominance  among  policemen. Years of service in the present position has negative significant correlation with  pessimism  whereas  native  place  has  positive  significant  correlation with this personality attribute. Size of the family has negative significant correlation with neuroticism among policemen. Number of dependents of policemen  reveals  negative  significant  correlation  with  ego-ideal, pessimism, neuroticism; need achievement, lack of self confidence, lack of dogmatism and overall personality.  

14. On the whole personality attributes and personal and family background variables  of  policemen  play  a  significant  role  in  their  perception  of  job stress.  
14. In nut shall it can be said that the crucial problem of job stress in policemen arise  from  the  personal  problems,  the  police  organization,  the  work environment,  personality  characteristics  and  personal  and  family background variables.  
14. Relationship  between  behavioural,  physiological  and  health  effects  and experience  of  stress  should  be  studied  and  kept  in  mind  while  handling stress situations and problems of policeman. 

xvii.  The  socio-political  environment  studies  should  be  conducted  on  pre-

terrorism and post terrorism stresses among policemen.  

**Remedial Measures and Techniques for Coping with Police Stress** 

302\. The stress situations in the police department should be handled both at the macro  and  micro  levels.  The  macro  level  measures  would  include reforms  at  the organizational level, improvement in the personnel parameters, modification in the work  procedures  and  reorientation  of  the  behavioural  and  response  patterns.  The micro level strategies for copying with the stress  situations would include measures like organizing specific training courses, developing guts in the policeman to make them capable to handle the stress situations, counseling and one to one interactions and improvement in the work environment and behavioral patterns at all levels. 302.1 The training courses to be organized at the institutional level along with on the job formal and informal training courses and interactions should include subjects like understanding of stress, the factors of stress, stress and personality, recognizing the harmful stress situations, self control, stress fundamentals, managing stress by fixing priorities and perspectives and learning stress management techniques.  

302\.2 In addition to these activities, field and research studies should be conducted from  time  to  time  and  the  senior-subordinate  interactions  and  the  colleague interactions  should  be  meaningfully  utilized  to  assess  the  stress  situations.  The observations and findings of these studies, interactions and various inputs pertaining to  stress  situations  at  the  micro  and  macro  levels  should  be  subjected  to  critical scrutiny and examination for finding out solutions commensurate with mitigation of stress situations for relieving the common and individual policeman in his personal and professional settings.

consideration and to sales of property for exorbitant prices. The fact that a police officer  lending  the  money  is  acting  as  an  executor,  administrator,  or  as  a  trustee without profit or advantage to himself, in no way affects the prohibition.

14) **Canvassing of Non-Official or Other Outside Influence**

No  police  officer  should  engage  in  any  strike  or  similar  activities  which  include commission  or  omission  involving  a  deliberate  intention  to  compel  his  superior officers or Government to do something and shall include any demonstrative fast usually called "Hunger Strike" for similar purposes. 

**(xviii) Religious   Activities** 

Though  the police  officers are entitled,  in  their  private  lives,  freely  to profess or practice any religion, they should so conduct themselves in public as to leave no room for  an  impression  to  arise  that  they  are  likely  in  their  official  dealings  to  favour persons belonging to any religion. Participation in proselytizing activities or direct or indirect use of official position or influence in such activities by a police officer is strictly prohibited. 

19) **Use of Vehicles** 

'The habitual use by police officers of transport belonging to members of the public is prohibited. 

20) **Payment of Camp Expenses** 

As far as possible camp supplies should not be purchased through the subordinate officers.  Where,  however,  the  employment  of  subordinates  or  village  officers  for making purchases of  camp  supplies  becomes  unavoidable,  touring  officers should make an advance payment for the required supplies at the beginning of their camp, settle the accounts at the end of the camp and obtain receipts for the same. All police officers, whenever they go on tour for inspection or otherwise, should at the end of the inspection or before leaving the camp publicly enquire of the officer whose office has been inspected or the village officers, as the case may be, if their staff has in any way levied enforced entertainment, gratuitous supply of provisions or any presents. They should ensure that all the services rendered or supplies provided for themselves and their staffs are paid for in full before leaving the camp. Whenever the Director General, Commissioner or the Superintendent receives complaints about non-payment of dues by any officer subordinate to them they should look into them and try to find out if the officer concerned really owes any money to the applicant. If, on enquiry, it is found that a police officer does owe money to the applicant, he should be instructed to pay it off within the specified time. If the police officer concerned refuses to pay the dues or prolongs payment, he will be liable for departmental action. If on enquiry it is found that the police officer does not owe any money, the applicant should be informed accordingly and if he is not satisfied with the reply, he should be asked to go to a civil court. 

21) **Use of Subordinate Police Officer on Private Business** 

The employment of a subordinate police officer in making purchases or in any private matter in which receipt or expenditure of money is concerned, is strictly prohibited. It is  however,  not  intended  that  this  prohibition  should  preclude  any  officer  from employing his subordinates to provide for him a conveyance or necessary supplies while he is travelling on duty on payment, though in all such transactions constant vigilance is needed to prevent cheating and extortion. 

**(xxii) Prohibition of Receipt of Rewards From Public** 

Police officers are strictly forbidden from receiving any kind of "Bhakshis, rewards or gratification" from members of the public, though the offer of such gratification may be trivial or of a customary nature on occasions like "Diwali, Dasara, Christmas", etc.  

**(xxiii) Behaviour Towards Members of Parliament and Legislatures** 

All police officers should give due courtesy and regard to the members of Parliament and State Legislatures who are representatives of the people. It should be borne in mind  that these  representatives  chosen  by the  people  have  important functions  to perform under the Constitution and it is the duty of every police officer to listen to them and redress the grievances put forth by them according to law to the best of their ability. When officers are unable to accede to the requests or suggestions, the reasons for  the  officer's  inability  to  do  so  should  be  courteously  explained  to  them.  The superior police officers should freely meet the Members of Parliament and Members of  Legislative  Assembly  and  Members  of  Legislative  Council  and  understand  the problems of their constituencies. 

**(xxiv) Representations   from   Members   of   the   Legislature** 

Whenever  members  of  the  Legislature  approach  Superintendents  or  other  police officers,  a  patient  hearing  should  be  given  to  them,  as  they  have  a  certain responsibility towards the public, As far as possible local members should be taken into confidence. 

**(xxv) Prompt Attention to and Disposal of Complaints From the Public** 

Prompt and efficient disposal of public grievances is the primary duty of every police officer. Officers should be ready to hear complaints requiring immediate attention at any time of the day, as far as possible, so that members of the public would feel confident that they can always approach the police officers concerned for redressal of their grievances in a sympathetic manner. The senior most officers present should receive the complaint. 

**(xxvi) Behaviour of Police Officers Towards the Public** 

1) Every member of the police force should regard himself as a servant and guardian of the general public and treat all law-abiding citizens, irrespective of their social position, with unfailing patience, courtesy and tact. While addressing members of the public, all officers and men must use the honorific plural to the person addressed. The aim should be to make the police force trusted and respected by the people. 
1) The heads of offices should ensure that their subordinates treat the members of the public approaching them on official business with consideration and courtesy, so as to encourage them to represent their grievances to them. They should also take steps to ensure that members of the public, when they come to see them on business are not kept waiting unnecessarily and their complaints and applications are promptly looked into and disposed of. 
1) A police officer should always remember to keep his temper. He is likely to be much more effective, if he is tactful, conciliatory or firm as the occasion demands.    
4) By the employment of tact and conciliatory but firm methods, the public ordinarily can be induced to comply with directions and thus the necessity of employing force may be obviated. But where strong action is really needed, a police officer should not feel shy of taking it for fear of allegations or complaints being made against him by the public, nor should he allow himself to be deflected from the right course of action by interference from any source. He can count upon the support of his superiors so long as he discharges his duties loyally, faithfully and honestly. 

   **(xxvii) Tending Evidence** 

   While giving evidence and on every other occasion, a police officer should speak the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. He must not be swayed by any desire to assert his own importance or to secure a conviction or an acquittal by any other temptations.  When repeating a conversation or statement, he should not exaggerate, misrepresent  or  suppress  any  part  of  it.  Every  police  officer  should  adopt  every legitimate means in his power to assist in raising the prestige of the service in the estimation of the public and in securing its goodwill and respect by right behaviour on or off duty. He should always be available to those who seek his aid. 

   **(xxviii) Guidance by Superior Officers** 

   Superior officers should encourage the subordinate officers to be upright, honest and faithful. They should put  down  with  a  firm  hand  arrogant,  overbearing,  rough or unmannerly conduct on the part of the subordinate police officers whenever it comes to their notice. It should be realised that no matter how successful one may be in the detection of crime or proficient in any field of police work, he is liable to be punished if he shows himself incapable of treating the public properly. 

   **(xxix) Behaviour of Station House Officers and The Staff** 

   Continuous efforts should be made to improve the existing relations between the force and  the  public  by  Station  House  Officers.  They  should  treat  complainants  with consideration and not regard them as persons creating work or soliciting a favour. They should not keep them waiting unnecessarily to have their complaints registered and attended to. Similarly, the complainants should not be harassed by asking them to provide supplies and transport. It should be remembered by the police officers that the complainant has already suffered a loss of some kind and unless he is treated with sympathy, understanding and consideration, the reputation of the police would be in serious jeopardy. Witnesses should be treated with consideration and with full respect due  to  their  standing  in  society.  In  dealing  with  suspects,  officers  should  be  as forbearing and reasonable as possible. Torture or use of force in any form should be strictly avoided. Under trial prisoners should be treated with consideration. Whatever the investigating officer may think of the charge and evidence against them, it should be borne in mind that the law does not consider them guilty until they are convicted. They are entitled to such reasonable consideration as is compatible with their safe custody and production before the Court. An ex-convict must be watched carefully to see whether he is really a bad character, but this can be done sympathetically and without harassment. If he improves, the watch can be gradually reduced. If he does not, the police are still in a position to know his movements and associates. It should be remembered that an ex-convict reformed means so many crimes not committed and hence  considerate  treatment  which  gives  him  a  chance  of  reforming  is  a  sound preventive measure. 

   **(xxx) Visitors to Residences** 

   Police officers  should  discourage  visits  of private persons, who  have  any dealing directly or indirectly with their work, to their residences and should not deal with official monetary transactions with them in their residences. 

   **(xxxi) Courteous Behaviour** 

   Every police officer must constantly remember that he is a servant of the public and is, therefore under an obligation to behave with proper courtesy towards them. Any police man whether in a police station or an outpost or on patrol duty or for that matter anywhere, is bound to help the public to the best of his ability. Police man should not impose more restrictions on the people than are warranted so far as their harmless actions, movements, conduct and speech are concerned. It is his duty to refrain from rude behaviour and the causing of annoyance while conducting searches, to act with strict regard for decency and with gentleness in dealing with women and children, and to treat every member of the public with politeness. When on duty, he must give his name and number, when asked by any member of the public. 

   **(xxxii) Police Officer's Behaviour While on Duty** 

   It is improper for police officers, while on duty in uniform to smoke, chew pan or talk leisurely with friends in public. Such exhibition creates an unfavourable impression in the minds of the public who cannot distinguish whether such men are on or off duty at that time. While on duty in plain clothes, the police officers should carry with them identification cards for being shown when required. 

   **(xxxiii) Neglect of Family and Children** 

   Police officers should maintain a decent standard of conduct even in their private lives and should not neglect to take proper care of their wives and children. Disregard by them of obligations towards their wives and children tend to injure their reputation and thereby undermine the trust and confidence which the public repose in them. 

   **(xxxiv) Behaviour Towards Officers of Other Departments** 

   The police officers should treat the officers of the other departments and organizations such as Judiciary, Home Guards and the Armed Forces with respect and courtesy due to their status and the rank they hold. Whenever the Army is called in aid of the civil power to deal with civil disturbances, senior police officers should ensure that the Army personnel of all ranks are given due respect by the members of the police force. 

   **(xxxv) Behaviour of Police Officers Towards Subordinates and Superiors**  

   Senior police officers must strictly avoid the use of unduly harsh language while addressing  or  talking  to  their  juniors  and  subordinates.  They  should  show  their subordinates  the  same  consideration  as  they  themselves  would  expect  from  their superiors.   It is essential that members of the subordinate staff, in turn, should behave respectfully towards their superiors and do their duty satisfactorily. 

   **(xxxvi) Consumption of Alcohol Drugs**  

   A police officer shall not consume any intoxicating drink or drug in a public place. 

   **(xxxvii) Behaviour of Police Parties During Journeys** 

   When police parties are sent from one district to another on duty, officers in charge of the parties must keep their men under proper control throughout the journey. When travelling by rail they should get suitable seating arrangements made by the railway authorities  and  should  not  inconvenience  other  passengers.  Whenever  possible, Superintendents or other police officers concerned should give timely intimation of the dispatch of large parties by train to the railway authorities not only of the starting stations but of all junctions on the route where the parties may have to change the trains.     

   **(xxxviii) Grant of Certificates to Individuals by Police Officers** 

   Police officers should not issue character certificate to members of the public as there is a grave danger inherent in this practice since a certificate of good character issued by  a  police  officer  creates  an  impression  that  the  police  authorities  have  nothing against the individual. Police officers are also forbidden from giving certificates of character or conduct to their subordinates other than discharge certificates. Superior police officers may attest copies of documents like testimonials, marriage, birth or death  certificates  required  for  recruitment  or  other  purposes  on  request  from  the members of the public.  This work, though not a legal formality, is only a civic duty related to their status. 

   **(xxxix) Salutes and Official Greetings** 

1) A salute is the military and police method of greeting superiors and not a servile act. It is an outward sign of inward spirit of discipline and respect for superior. The unity and discipline of a force are indicated by the manner in which the men salute and the officers return them. 
1) Failure  to  salute  shows  disrespect,  idleness  and  a  low  standard  of  discipline. Failure by* an officer in uniform to insist on being saluted is a breach of discipline. 
1) A subordinate officer will always salute a superior officer first.  It is good manners for a junior officer to salute a senior officer, when they meet, though they may be of the same rank. 
1) Any  police  officer  who  is  saluted  will  smartly  acknowledge  the  salute.  The importance  of  returning  a  salute  correctly  and  with  courtesy  cannot  be  over- emphasized.  It is  bad  manners  to  acknowledge  a  salute  by raising  a  stick, by  an indifferent gesture of the hand or with the disengaged hand in the trouser pocket. Officers  returning  the  salutes  of  subordinates  must  regard  it  not  as  a  matter  of condescension but as a bounden duty. 
5) The salute will be given and returned with the right hand. Where, however, a salute with the right hand is impossible through physical incapacity, he will stand to attention. 
5) When a police officer in civilian clothes meets another police officer to whom a salute is due, he should smartly come to attention. 
5) When a police officer in civilian clothes meets a person other than a police officer to whom a salute is due, he should greet him in the traditional Indian style "Namaste". 
5) When  a  police  officer  who  is  in  civilian  clothes  receives  a  salute,  he  should acknowledge with appropriate greeting or order. 
5) Police  officers  should  salute  when  passing,  addressing  or  being  addressed  by police officers, senior to them in rank, whether in uniform or in plain clothes. 
5) Subordinate police officers in uniform should salute all gazetted officers of the Government  and  commissioned  officers  in  uniform  of  the  Navy,  Army,  Air  and Auxiliary Forces, when addressing them or being spoken to by them. 
5) Subordinate police officers in uniform should salute all the magistrates, when the latter are on magisterial duty. 
5) If the nature of the duty such as regulating traffic or other special circumstances make it undesirable, a police officer will not be required to salute unless spoken to by a person entitled to be saluted. 
5) When a senior officer enters a room in a police station or class room, the men in the room will stand to attention until they are told to resume their seats or occupation. The senior officer present will call the men to attention; otherwise, the first man who observes any senior officer entering a room should give notice to the others by calling them to attention.  
5) When two are more officers are together, the senior only, whether in uniform or not, will return the salute. 
5) Officers or men passing the troops with uncased standards, guidens or colours will salute  except when  they are  carried  by units forming  part  of  the  escort  at  a military/police funeral. 
16) Cased standards, guidens and colours will not be saluted. 
16) Officers, men and colours, passing a military police funeral will salute the bier. When two or more officers are standing at a group or in a line, the senior most of them will salute after calling the others to attention. 
16) When appearing in a conference or assembly of superior officers, only the senior most officer will be saluted. It is incorrect to salute in turn other officers. 
16) An officer in uniform, wearing a headdress and appearing in an office or orderly room before a senior officer, will salute, retain his head-dress and stand to attention unless he is asked to sit down. On being asked to sit down, he should remove his head-dress. It is highly improper to place the head-dress on the table of the superior officer, or to retain it on one's head while sitting. It is similarly improper to wear dark glasses when addressing or being addressed by a senior officer.  
16) All officers and constables will salute the court (the Magistrate or Judge) on entering the Court room. 
16) When wearing western style civilian dress, it is etiquette and good manners to remove the head-dress before entering the room of a superior officer or a dwelling place of any kind. 
16) When a senior officer comes to a function accompanied by a lady, the officer will be  greeted  first  if  the  function  is  an  official  parade  and  the  officer  is  to  be  the reviewing officer. Otherwise, on all other occasions the lady will be greeted first. 
16) When  officers  are  in  a  body  apart  from  the  parade,  all  of  them  will  salute independently  on  the  approach  of  a  superior  officer.  If,  however,  they  are  on  an official parade, they will be called to attention by the senior-most officer among them who alone will salute. 
16) When a senior officer arrives on parade, he is greeted by the parade commander who calls the parade to attention and salute. It is not necessary for an officer on the parade to salute when the senior officer is going round to inspect the parade unless addressed by him or having occasion to address him. 
16) If the senior officer arrives after the parade has started, the parade will not be called to attention. The parade commander will himself salute the superior officer and obtain instructions from him. 
26) When  the  superior  officer  goes  round  the  parade  ground,  the  sub-unit commanders only will salute, if they are not engaged in instructing their squads. They will  otherwise  continue  without  diverting  their  attention  to  greet  the  officer.  If, however, the superior addresses any squad commander, the latter will immediately stop his instructions, bring his squad to attention, and will himself salute. After having done with the superior officer, he will proceed with his squad in accordance with the programme. 
26) When at a ceremonial parade the command 'National Salute- Present Arms is given, and the national anthem is not played, all police officers present but not on parade will stand to attention until the order 'Slope Arms' is given. When, however the national anthem is played all officers of and above rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector not on parade except those officers attending or accompanying the personage taking the  salute,  will  salute.  Other  non-gazetted  officers  will  stand  to  attention  without saluting. Officers attending or accompanying the personage will stand to attention but will not salute. 
26) All those who are not wearing uniform will stand to attention when the national anthem is played. Those wearing hats will doff them. 
26) The following orders should be observed when the national anthem is played : 
1. While on parade, all officers of the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector and above will salute, and the men will come to attention. This does not apply to ceremonial parade when men will present arms. 
1. While on the move, the party commander will halt the party and will salute, whereas the rest of the men will remain at attention. 
1. If standing in an organised party, the salute will be given only by the officer of the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector and above, except that a Head Constable will salute, if he is in charge of a party and the others will come to attention. 
1. All ranks wearing Indian style civilian dress will stand to attention. 
1. All sentries on duty will slope arms. 
1. All officers carrying a drawn sword will remain at the carry. 
30) When police are posted for street lining on public occasions such as Presidential or  Governor  visits,  mounted  and  dismounted  officers  of  and  above  the  rank  of Inspector will salute every member of the President's family, the Governor or other distinguished  personage  for  whom  the  occasion  is  held,  the  colours  of  the  Navy, Standards  and  Colours  (uncased)  of  the  Army  and  Air  Force,  and  senior  police officers.  Police  officers  below  the  rank  of  Inspector  will  not  salute,  but  stand  to attention. 

    31) A police officer in uniform should salute the wife of his superior or colleague or a lady of superior or equal status; it is incorrect to do 'namaste' while in uniform.

   **Medals** 

   328\. The Government of India have instituted the following medals :     

1. The  President's  Police  and  Fire  Services  Medals  for  gallantry  or distinguished service.     
1. Police Medals for gallantry or meritorious service;  
1. Prime Minister's Medal for life-saving; and  
4. Police (Special Duty) Medal. 

328\.1 The President's Police and Fire Services Medal and the Police Medal will be awarded  to  the  members  of  the  Police  Forces  and  organised  Fire  Services  in consideration of gallantry or meritorious services and outstanding devotion to duty. While  the medals, either the President's Police Fire Services Medal or the Police Medal, for gallantry are awarded for particular acts of gallantry, the President's Police and Fire Services Medal for distinguished service will be awarded for exceptional skill or conspicuous devotion to duty and the Police Medal for conspicuous merit. 

**Eligibility Parameters** 

329\. Normally no recommendation should be made for the award of President's Police Medal for distinguished Service unless the officer has completed 20 years of service and a period of 6 years has elapsed since the award of Police Medal for meritorious service. Similarly, no recommendation should be made for the award of Police Medal for meritorious service unless the officer has completed 15 years of service. There may, however, be very exceptional cases where it should be proper to award these medals although the conditions in respect of length of distinguished or meritorious services and the period which should lapse since the previous award, are not fulfilled, in such cases the conditions may be relaxed at the discretion of the Government of India. Such recommendations should be sent separately from the normal provision and they should be accompanied by a statement of reasons which would justify the waiving  of  the  normal  requirements.  It  should,  however,  be  borne  in  mind  that recommendations  under  these  special  provisions  are  to  be  made  only  under  very exceptional circumstances. This criterion does not apply to the recommendation for gallantry award. 

329\.1  It  would  be  incongruous  to  award  a  lower  medal  like  Police  Medal  for meritorious service where an officer has already been given medal for distinguished service like President's Police Medal. But there could be no objection- for the award of a lower gallantry medal, e.g., Police Medal for gallantry notwithstanding the fact that the officer holds a higher gallantry medal. 

**Procedure and Method** 

330\. Recommendations for the award of medals for gallantry should be marked secret and submitted to the Director General and Inspector-General of Police through the Range Inspector General/ or Commissioner, as the case may be, immediately after the promulgation  of  the  act  which  occasions  the  recommendations.  These  will  be considered by the Government of India, as and when they are received. In other cases, the awards will be made twice a year on the occasion of the Republic Day (26th January) and the Independence Day (15th August). Recommendations for the awards, which are due with the Government of India by the 26th October and 15th May, should be  marked  secret  and  submitted  through  the  Range  Inspector  general  or  the Commissioner, as the case maybe, so as to reach the Director General and Inspector- General of Police by the 10lh September and the 1st April, respectively, each year. Full names  of  the  individuals  recommended,  their  rank,  the  number  of  years  of  their service in the police and full details of their previous good work and of the particular act or acts for which the grant of the medal is recommended, with dates of incidents referred to, should be given, A list of good service entries and rewards carried by each person  should  accompany  the  recommendations.  The  citation  should  be comprehensive  without  being  unduly  long.  The  citation  for  the  President's  Police Medal for distinguished service should clearly indicate whether the officer has already been awarded the Police Medal for Meritorious Service. 

**Certification** 

331\.  A  certificate  in  the  following  form  should  be  furnished  in  respect  of  each recommendation: 

**CERTIFICATE** 

Certified that the integrity of Shri......................................................recommended for the  award  of  the  President's  Police  and  Fire  Services  Medal/Police  Medal  for gallantry/ Distinguished/Meritorious service is above suspicion and that he has neither incurred censure nor was concerned in proceedings that were censured in a court of law. It is further certified that in respect of the conduct of the nominee underlying the present recommendation, no judicial proceedings are pending. 

331\.1 No recommendation for award of medal for distinguished or meritorious service 

should be sent, where an officer has been awarded a punishment. However, in cases 

where an officer has been censured or awarded minor punishment outside a court of law for minor shortcomings, a statement should be furnished showing the nature of punishment and the circumstances in which the officer was punished indicating the reasons which justify the officer being considered especially for the award. 

331\.2 While forwarding nominations for the award of the President's Police and Fire Services Medal for distinguished services and the award of the President's Police and Fire Services Medal and Police Medal for gallantry, copies of photographs of the officer who is considered for such award should be sent. The photographs of the nominees should be secured without divulging the recommendations of their names for the award of the medals. 

331\.3 While sending the recommendations for gallantry, in addition to the citation, the following information/document should be furnished:- 

1) A copy of the first information report or the report made to the Director General or the State Government about the incident. 
1) Details about the composition of the Police Party and in case the party has been divided into groups, the number of Policemen included in each group should  be  mentioned.  The  details  of  arms  carried  by  the  Police  party should be mentioned. 
1) The details of the injuries, if received, by the Police personnel should be furnished. 
1) Details of the injuries, if received, by the criminals and in case the criminal was  killed  in  the  incident  a  copy  of  the  postmortem  report  should  be furnished. 
1) If any magisterial inquiry and/or departmental inquiry was conducted into the matter, a copy of the inquiry report should also be furnished.  

**Publicity of the Award**  

332\. The award of the President's Police and Fire Services Medal for distinguished service and gallantry and the award of the Police Medal for gallantry are ordinarily given pictorial publicity. Citations of only gallantry awards and distinguished service will be read out at the time of the presentation of the medals to the recipients, in an investiture parade. The Master of Mint, Government of India, sends the respective medals to the State Government which, in turn, sends them to the Director General and Inspector-General of Police for safe custody and presentation to the awardees during the investiture parade arranged for the purpose. 

332\.1  Whenever  departmental  or  criminal  proceedings  are  pending  against  the awardees  of  the  medal,  their  names  should  be  promptly  reported  to  the  Director General and Inspector-General of Police, so that the presentation of the medals could be withheld till the proceedings are over. The President's Police Medal and the Police Medal are liable to be forfeited when the holder is guilty of disloyalty, cowardice in action  or  such  conduct  as  in  the  opinion  of  the  President  brings  the  force  into disrepute. 

**The Prime Minister's Medal for Life-Saving** 

333\. The Prime Minister's Medal for Life-Saving will be awarded in cases where exemplary  devotion  to  duty  is  shown  by  a  Police  officer  in  saving  human  life. Recommendations for the award of the medal should be marked secret and submitted to  the  Director  General  and  Inspector-General  of  Police  through  the  IGP/Deputy Inspector-General or Commissioner, as the case may be, soon after the event takes place, with full facts of the case. The announcement and the presentation of the award will be made by the Government of India during the All-India Police Duty Meet. 

**The Police (Special Duty) Medal** 

334\. The Police (Special Duty) Medal will be awarded to the members of the Police Forces  in  recognition  of  their  services  under  condition  of  particular  hardship  and severe climate. Recommendation for the award of this medal should be sent as soon as  officers  become  eligible  for  the  award  through  proper  channel.  If  an  officer recommended for the award of any of the medals dies before the award is actually announced,  necessary  intimation  should  be  given  to  the  Director  General  and Inspector-General of Police, immediately. In the case of officers on deputation, the borrowing authority will consult the lending authority before recommending a medal and vice-versa. 

**The Order and Manner of Wearing Decorations and Medals** 

335\. The order of precedence of wearing the various medals and decorations as per the rules should be strictly followed. When medals and decorations are worn on the breast,  the  ribbon  will  be  one  inch  in  length,  unless  the  possession  of  clasp necessitates its being longer. The uppermost clasp will be one inch from the top of the ribbon. When two or more medals and decorations are worn, they will be so arranged that the lower edges are in line. The length of all ribbons will be regulated by that of the  decoration  or  medal  which,  including  clasps,  is  the  longest,  subject  to  the condition that the total length of the ribbon and the decoration or medal together should be 3 "These instructions apply equally to miniature medals and decorations but their length including ribbon should be 2". The bar from which badges of orders, decorations or medals are suspended will be placed immediately above the left breast pocket of jackets with an open collar, and the centre of the bar midway between the first  and  the  second  buttons  of  jackets  fitted  with  a  stand-up  collar.  When  the decorations and medals cannot, on account of their number, be suspended from the bar so as to be fully seen, they are to overlap. The medals are to be worn so as to show the State Emblem. 

**Loss of Medal to be Reported** 

336\. All losses of medals should be reported by the recipients to the Director-General through proper channel. They will be replaced on payment of the cost by the recipient subject to the orders of the Government after due enquiry. In order that the good work done by the recipients of the Police Medals should not be lost sight of and should serve as an incentive to young officers, a board should be maintained in the District Police Offices, Unit Offices and District Armed Reserves on which the names of officers and men, who have been awarded the medals instituted by the Government of India, should be written. 

**Award by State Govts.** 

337\. The State Govt may formulate rules for giving rewards, and medals as they deem fill and proper from time to time. 



|**Chapter 18** |
| - |
||
|**Departmental Action, Punishments and Appeals** |
||
||
|**Introduction** |
|338\.  Reward  and  Punishment  are  two  essential  tools  of  administration  and|
|management. That good and commendable performance must be suitably rewarded|
|and  the  dereliction  of  duty  should  be  punished,  are  the  two  universally  accepted|
|principles of administration. Use, utility and inevitability of these principles become|
|more apparent for the organisation like police, where code of conduct, discipline and|
|performance expectations occupy significant place in the overall professional milieu.|
|The  parameters,  procedures  and  methods  of  punishment  and  departmental|
|proceedings like those of the rewards, should also be based on judicious, objective|
|and just foundations. For every category of personnel, separate rules and provisions|
|are made for this purpose and police organisations are no exception to this general|
|rule. |
||
|**The Rules** |
|339\. The IPS Officers are governed by the All India Services (Discipline & Appeal)|
|Rules, 1969 called the 'IPS Rules.' The members of the State service are governed by|
|the  State  Police  (Disciplinary  Proceedings)  Rules,  and  for  subordinate  ranks,|
|disciplinary rules on the similar lines are formulated by every State Govt. |
||
|339\.1 The acts of commission and omission at variance from the prescribed procedure|
|and standards, misuse of office, moral turpitude and unprofessional conduct, are all|
|met with disciplinary action so as to have a salutary deterrent effect on the erring|
|members as also on others. The cardinal principle of disciplinary proceedings is that|
|no one shall be punished unless he has been given reasonable opportunity to defend|
|himself against the action proposed to be taken against him. |
||
|**Classification of Punishments and Penalties**  |
||
|340\. The penalties authorised under the various rules and Acts could be the following. |

2\.  Minor penalties  

340\.1 There two categories of penalties, are prescribed in the 'IPS Rules', also. 

**General Principle of Punishment** 

341\. Punishment should fit the default and should be sufficiently deterrent without being harsh, and above all it should be immediately felt. 

1) If minor punishments have no effect on a delinquent a major punishment should be called for. If, such punishment has no effect on him, then he must be removed from service. Removing a Police officer from service without first awarding him minor punishments and lastly a major punishment will mean that proper steps were not taken to correct him in time and make him a useful member of the force. 
1) The degree of severity of punishment should depend upon the seriousness of the default and incorrigibility of the delinquent and should aim, as far as circumstances permit, at improving him and giving him a chance to improve. 
1) It is not correct to punish a person merely on suspicion or insufficient evidence. If the charge is not proved and the circumstances of the case demand that benefit of doubt should be given, officers should state their opinion clearly. 
1) Police  Officers  found  guilty  of  behaving  improperly  towards  members  of  the public should be dealt with severely in the interest of creating and maintaining good relations between the police and the public. Similarly, insubordination warrants the maximum punishment of dismissal from service, unless there are any extenuating circumstances or other valid answers to the charge. Leniency in such cases tends to foster a sense of indiscipline and indifference towards superior officers. 
1) Fraud, dishonesty, corruption or continued and willful negligence and all offences involving moral disgrace meet with their appropriate punishment in dismissal. 
1) Offences of gambling committed by the Police Officers should be treated as cases involving moral turpitude. Accordingly such Police Officers as are found guilty either by courts of law or any departmental proceedings should be dealt with severely. 
1) Removal should be the penalty in all cases where it is not thought necessary to bar future re-employment under Government in another department for which the Police Officer may be suited, and an order of removal, should not be accompanied by any 

   subsidiary orders which would operate as such bar or otherwise prejudice him. 

8) Except for absence without leave, fine shall not be inflicted as a punishment. 
8) Fine should ordinarily be imposed only on Head Constables and Constables. 
8) The  black-mark  system should  be  applicable  only  to Assistant  Sub-Inspectors, Head Constables and Constables and Officers of corresponding ranks. The system of punishment by black-marks should follow a system and a delinquent police officer shall not be punished by the award both of a specific punishment and of a black-mark. A black-mark should not be awarded for petty offences for which punishment drill, extra guard duty, extra work or fatigue duty might be sufficient. Three black-marks shall ordinarily entail reduction of pay or rank or reduction to a lower grade of pay in the  same  time-scale  whenever  such  reduction  is  possible.  When  no  reduction  is possible the three black-marks will stand with a warning that more than three marks will  entail  dismissal.  Six-black-marks  shall  ordinarily  entail  dismissal.  Before ordering dismissal or reduction referred to above, the procedure laid down in the Rule, shall be followed. Uninterrupted good conduct for a period of two years spent on duty shall cancel one black-mark and every such successive period of two years uninterrupted good  conduct shall cancel  one black-mark.  A  reduction  in grade  or reduction to a lower rate of pay in the time-scale in lien of black marks shall cancel all black-marks outstanding. Black-marks shall take effect from the date of the offence, unless otherwise stated. 

**Censure** 

342\.  Censure  should  not  be  awarded  for  minor  irregularities  or  lapses,  where  a warning would suffice. 

1) The main distinction between 'warning' and 'censure' or 'black-mark' is that an order of 'censure' or 'black-mark', as the case may be, should be a penalty under the Police Act. It is intended to convey that the Police Officer concerned has been held guilty of some blameworthy act or omission for which it has been found necessary to award  him  a  formal  punishment.  Nothing  can  amount  to  a  'censure'  unless  it  is intended to be such a formal punishment and imposed for 'good and sufficient reasons' after following the procedure prescribed in the Rules. 
1) There may be occasions when a superior officer may find it necessary to criticise adversely  the  work  of  his  subordinates  which  calls  for  some  informal  action, communication of a written warning, admonition or reprimand may be taken recourse to. 
3) It is a matter of simple natural justice that written warnings, reprimands, etc. should not be administered or placed on a Police Officer's confidential record unless the authority doing so is satisfied that there is good and sufficient reason to do so.  

   **Withholding of Increments or Promotion** 

   343\.  An  increment  is  admissible  as  a  matter  of  course  unless  it  is  specifically withheld. It may be withheld from a Police officer (i) if his conduct has not been good or his work has not been satisfactory, and (ii) as a definite punishment for a specific fault.  The  procedure  prescribed  in  Rule  shall  be  followed  before  withholding  an increment. Where it is proposed to withhold an increment in an officer's pay as a punishment,  the  authority  inflicting  the  punishment  should,  before  the  order  is actually passed, consider whether it will affect the officer's pension and, if so, to what extent; if it is decided finally to withhold the increment, the order should make it clear that the effect of the punishment on the pension has been considered and that its effect is intended. In ordering the withholding of an increment, the withholding authority shall expressly state in the order : 

1. the period for which it is withheld; 
1. whether the period for which it is withheld shall be exclusive of  any interval spent on leave before that period is complete. 
1. whether  the  postponement  shall  have  the  effect  of  postponing  future increments. 

**Reduction to a Lower Rank, Grade or Stage** 

344\. No Police Officer should, who was directly recruited, be reduced to a rank lower than that to which he was directly recruited. Wholesale reduction by a number of grades or stages at a time should not be ordered. Drastic reductions may be within the letter of the rules, but they are not in keeping with their spirit and are undesirable from every point of view. 

In ordering a reduction, the punishing authority shall expressly state in the order :- 

1) the rank, grade or stage to which reduced ; 
2) the period for which reduction is ordered ; 
2) the period  of reduction  should  be  wholly  spent  on duty  excluding  any period of leave or suspension ; 
2) whether reduction, if to a lower stage in the same time scale, shall have the effect of postponing future increments ; 
2) whether the effect of the punishment on pension has been considered and whether the order is intended to have that effect ; and 
2) whether in the case of reduction to a lower rank he should gain promotion to the next rank in the ordinary course but not restored to his original rank at the expiration of the period of reduction. 

**Imposition of Minor Punishments** 

345\. The procedure laid down in Rules of the 'State Rules' or the 'IPS Rules', as the case may be, shall be followed for imposing any of the minor penalties. 

**Imposition of Major Penalties** 

346\. The procedure laid down in the 'State Rules' or the 'IPS Rules', as the case may be, should be strictly followed before imposing any one of the major penalties on a police officer. Neglect in the due observance of the provisions of the rule is liable to vitiate the whole proceedings and the ultimate order passed thereon. It may often happen that though on merits an order of punishment may be fully justified, it may have  to  be  set  aside  on  account  of  technical  defect  or  omission  or  irregularity committed in the disciplinary proceedings. This may often enable a guilty officer to escape punishment as also cause considerable financial loss to the Government.  

**Suspension** 

347\. Suspension, as a specific punishment, should be rarely awarded and used only in special  circumstances,  and  the  period  should  not  in  any  case  exceed  to  an unreasonable extent. 

Suspension will take effect from the date of receipt of order by the Officer suspended. Suspension as a specific punishment should not be inflicted in cases where a Police Officer has been placed under suspension pending disposal of inquiry or criminal prosecution.  During  the  period  a  Police  Officer  undergoes  this  punishment,  his powers, rights and liabilities will be the same as those of an Officer placed under suspension pending inquiry or criminal prosecution. During the period of suspension, the pay and allowances will be regulated in accordance with Rule.  

348\. **Basic Consideration for Suspension** 

1) Placing a Police Officer under suspension would imply the commencement of an inquiry in a disciplinary proceeding. An officer should be suspended only, if, a prima-facie* case exists for instituting an inquiry.  
1) The purpose in placing an officer under suspension is to keep him away from a position where he can interfere with the conduct of the inquiry or tamper with the documentary or oral evidence in any manner, or, where, having regard to the nature of the charges against him, it is felt that it would be unsafe to continue to vest in him the powers of his post. 
1) In cases of criminal prosecution, the concerned accused Police Officers should ordinarily be suspended. 
1) Before placing a Police Officer under suspension, the authority competent to place him under suspension should examine the case as to whether the default is so serious as to merit suspension. He should also carefully consider whether on the basis of evidence available there is a prima-facie case for dismissal or removal from service or if there is reason to believe that his continuance in active service is likely to cause embarrassment or hamper the inquiry. In other cases, the concerned Police Officer could be transferred to a far-off place, if such a course is necessary in the interest of the inquiry. 
1) The  officer  who passes an  order of suspension  of a  Police  Officer should record his reasons therefore under his signature. 
1) The following are the circumstances under which the Police Officer may be placed under suspension. 
1. Where continuance in office of the Government Servant will prejudice the investigation, trial or any inquiry (i.e., apprehended tampering with witnesses or documents). 
2. Where continuance in office of the Government Servant is likely to seriously  subvert  discipline  in  the  office  in  which  the  Government Servant is working; 
2. Where a Government Servant is prosecuted for any offence committed in the course of his duty involving moral turpitude. 
2. Corruption, embezzlement or misappropriation of Government money or money of a foreign employer under whom the Government Servant has worked on deputation or otherwise, possession of disproportionate assets, misuse of official powers for personal gain. 
2. Serious negligence  and dereliction of duty resulting in considerable loss to government and to the foreign employer while the Government Servant had worked on deputation. 
2. return to duty after unauthorised absence. 
2. refusal, or deliberate failure, to carry out written orders of superior officers. 

348\.1 The Officer of the rank of Deputy Inspector-General and Superintendent of Police may suspend an Inspector or a Reserve Inspector or a Subedar Major or a Subedar  and  below  pending  inquiry  into  charges  of  misconduct.  A  Deputy Superintendent or an officer of the corresponding rank may suspend an officer not above the rank of Head Constable and obtain later the approval of the Dy. Inspector General or the Superintendent of Police. The authorities superior to these authorities may also order suspension of a Police Officer pending disposal of an inquiry-or a criminal prosecution. Suspension shall take effect from the date of receipt of the order by the officer affected, unless he is an absentee without leave, in which case it will take effect from the date of absence from duty. In the case of criminal prosecution, it takes effect from the date of arrest. 

**Suspended Person not to leave Headquarter** 

349\. When a Police Officer is placed under suspension pending inquiry, he should not leave the station where his office is situated without obtaining the permission of the authority competent to fill up the appointment. When the permission is granted, he is free to go anywhere he likes. But he must leave his address with the Head of Office. He must also leave his address with the officer, if any, holding the inquiry. If and when there is a change in his address he must promptly intimate the same to all concerned. All correspondence relating to the inquiry will be communicated only to notified addresses and this would be in full compliance with the serving of notices to an accused officer.  

349\.1 When a Police Officer, occupying the Government quarters without licence fee concession is suspended from service, he will cease to get the government quarters without  licence  fee  concession  from  the  date  of  suspension.  Where  the accommodation free of licence fee is attached to his post he may be allowed two months' time to vacate the quarters. However, from the date of suspension licence fee will  be  recovered  from  him  on  the  assumption  that  he  was  not  in  occupation  of accommodation without licence fee at the time of suspension. If he does not vacate the  quarters  within  the  specified  time,  three  times  the  usual  licence  fee  shall  be recovered for the first three months beyond the specified period. If he does not vacate the quarters within a period of three months, the quarters shall be got vacated by taking appropriate steps.  

349\.2 Where a Police Officer is placed under suspension, it is particularly necessary to  expedite  the  inquiry  against  him  and  to  complete  it  as  early  as  possible. Arrangements should be made to divest the officer to be placed under suspension, of arms and ammunition on his-person and/or in his custody, and thereafter the orders of suspension served on him. Even while holding inquiries, the Inquiry Officer should ensure that the accused Police Officer whether under suspension or otherwise facing the inquiry, is completely disarmed and is not in possession of any kind of arms, ammunition or other implements. A Police Officer under suspension on a charge of misconducts either facing inquiry or criminal prosecution may be permitted to retire on reaching the date of superannuation.  

349\.3  When  a  Police  Officer  is  placed  under  suspension  at  the  instance  of  the Lokayukta  he  should  not  be  reinstated  before  completion  of  the  inquiry  without consulting  the  Commission.  When  the  authority  competent  to  release  him  under suspension does not agree with the views of the Lokayukta in this regard, he should refer the matter to the Government through the Director General, for orders. 

350\. **Period of Suspension** 

(1) Police Officer placed under suspension should be reinstated in service if the stages of investigation or inquiry/trial following the date of suspension are not adhered to according to the schedule below i.e., where - 

- the investigation into the allegations against Government Servants have not commenced within three months from the date of suspension; 
- the  investigation  into  the  allegations  against  Government  Servants  is  not completed  within  six  months  from  the  date  of  commencement  of  the investigation; 
- the inquiry/trial has not commenced within three months on conclusion of the investigation; 
- the  inquiry/trial  has  not  concluded  within twelve  months  from  the  date of commencement of the inquiry/trial or from the date of suspension whichever is later. The period laid down for continuing a Government Servant under suspension  is  only  an  outer  limit  and  does  not  prevent  the  appropriate authorities from reinstating the Government Servant earlier if circumstances of the case warrant.  

2\.  Where  any  department,  having  regard  to  the  gravity  of  the  allegation  and  the complexity of the case in respect of the following types of cases is of the view that the time  schedule  laid  down  in  the  preceding  para  cannot  be  adhered  to  and  further continuance of the suspension of Government Servants is justified, such cases may be examined on their own merit and a decision taken by the Minister concerned whether to continue suspension; 

- Moral turpitude; 
- Corruption (including trap cases, embezzlement or misappropriation of money of Government or a foreign employer, possession of disproportionate assets and misuse of official power for personal gain); 
- Refusal or deliberate failure to carry out written orders of superior officers 

**Preliminary   Enquiry** 

351\.  Before  commencing  any  disciplinary  action  against  a  Police  Officer,  it  is necessary that sufficient evidence is gathered by way of preliminary enquiry for the satisfaction  of  the  authority  that  there  is  sufficient  prima  facie*  evidence  to  start disciplinary  proceedings  against  the  Police  Officer  concerned.  This  preliminary enquiry  may  be  made  by  or  under  the  orders  of  any  officer  under  whose administrative control the officer alleged to be at fault is working but the decision to hold the inquiry can only be taken by the disciplinary authority under the Rules. 

351\.1 Such preliminary enquiry may be conducted against the Police Officers by their senior rank officers as per the decision of the competent authority. 

351\.2 On completion of the preliminary enquiry the  authority should, after going through the papers of enquiry, decide : 

1) whether a prima-facie* case exists for further action ; 
1) if so, whether an inquiry should be held or whether the Police Officer should be prosecuted in a court of law ; 
1) whether  the  Police  Officer  concerned  should  be  suspended  pending  an inquiry or prosecution ; 
1) whether   the   services   of   the   Police   Officer  concerned   could   and   should be terminated without an inquiry. 

351\.3 Any officer may ask for an explanation from a subordinate officer in respect of any matter pertaining to his duties and it will often be advisable before initiating an inquiry to obtain the explanation as, after obtaining it, the reporting authority may feel that there is no case to initiate an inquiry at all. The taking of such explanation is, however, not compulsory and the authority competent to order the inquiry will have to decide,  according  to  the  circumstances  of  each  case,  whether  or  not  any  such explanation should be obtained before issue of a memo of charge.  

351\.4 If the preliminary enquiry does not reveal misconduct of such serious nature as to merit the imposition of any of the major penalties, but is felt that some informal action is called for, a written warning, or reprimand may be communicated to the erring officer. In appropriate case action for imposing minor penalties may be taken. 

**Inquiring Authority** 

352\. Once the disciplinary authority is satisfied that an inquiry is necessary, or he is directed by higher authority to hold an inquiry, the first step will be to appoint an Inquiring officer. If the higher authority has directed the officer to hold the inquiry himself, he himself will be the Inquiring Authority. While appointing the Inquiring Authority the competent authority should ensure that the officer selected to conduct the inquiry is a person who has not conducted the preliminary enquiry and who has not at any time, before being so appointed, expressed an opinion about the guilt of the accused Police Officer. 

352\.1  Appointment  of  an  Inquiring  Authority  should  ordinarily  be  made  by designation and not by name. If the incumbent in an office is changed due to transfer, etc., his successor shall continue the inquiry from where it was left by his predecessor. The  Disciplinary  Authority,  issuing  the  order  of  appointment  of  an  Inquiring Authority to conduct an inquiry, should prepare four copies of the order. The original and duplicate copies should be sent to the Head of the Office under whom the accused Police Officer is serving, for service and return of the duplicate copy bearing the acknowledgement of the accused Police Officer direct to the Inquiring Authority. The third copy should be sent to the Inquiring Authority and the fourth copy should be retained by the disciplinary authority as his office copy. The acknowledged duplicate copy  received  from  the  accused  Police  Officer  should  be  filed  in  the  original departmental enquiry records. Joint Inquiry* Where more than one Police Officer of different ranks are involved in a single default and it has been decided to hold a joint inquiry against all such accused Police Officers, the disciplinary authority in respect of the accused Police Officer holding the highest rank or post, should appoint the Inquiring Authority in respect of all accused Police Officers. In such cases, sufficient number of copies of the order should be prepared for service on all the accused Police Officers. 

353\. **Precautions** 

1) It is desirable that, in all instances where the charge is grave enough to warrant dismissal, removal, compulsory retirement or reduction to a lower rank of Inspector, the officer who conducts the inquiry should ordinarily be not lower in rank than that of a Superintendent. 
1) The officer appointed to conduct the inquiry should conduct it himself and not entrust it to any other officer. 
1) An officer who is to be cited as a prosecution witness during an inquiry cannot hold the inquiry. If he is required as a defence witness by the accused officer, the latter should be asked to state in writing what points the officer is cited to elucidate. If the Inquiring Authority considers it unnecessary to allow himself to be examined as a defence witness, he will file that representation with his remarks as part of the records of the inquiry and incorporate the facts contained in that application and his remarks thereon  in  the  minute.  In  case,  however,  the  Inquiring  Authority  thinks  that  his examination as a defence witness is really necessary, he should immediately report the matter to his immediate superior and seek instructions for the appointment of another' inquiring Authority. When the officer's evidence is considered such as is likely  to  have  a  bearing  on  the  result  of  the  inquiry,  the  inquiry  should  not  be conducted by him but by some other officer. 
1) The Inquiring Authority should maintain a record in the form of an order sheet, in which he should make a brief record of the day-to-day proceedings of the inquiry including oral and written requests of the accused Police Officer and the orders passed on such requests. 

   **Issue of Memo of Charge** 

   354\. The Inquiring Authority should frame a memo of charge containing : 

1) Definite charge or charges. 
1) Under each charge, the grounds on which that charge is based. 
1) Any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders in the case.  
4) Each charge should be drawn up clearly and precisely and care should be taken to avoid vagueness. 
4) The place, date and time of the incident should invariably be specified in the charge. 
4) A full and clear statement of the allegations in support of each charge shall be set forth in the memo of charge. 
4) The names of prosecution witnesses (to be styled P.Ws.) and documents to prove each charge, will be mentioned.  
4) Three copies of the memo of charge should be prepared and duly signed. The third copy will be retained by the Inquiring Authority. The original and duplicate copies will be delivered to the accused Police Officer requiring him to return forthwith the duplicate copy duly acknowledged retaining the original for his personal use. 

**Written Statement in Defence** 

355\. The Inquiring Authority should fix a reasonable lime within which the written statement  must  be  filed.  In  dealing  with  requests,  if  any,  for  further  time  by  the accused  Police  officer,  the  Inquiring  Authority  will  consider  whether  he  accused Police Officer is sufficiently serious in the preparation of his defence and whether the time asked for is really necessary. An accused Police Officer must have reasonable facilities for the preparation of his defence, and subject to this condition, it is the Inquiring Authority's responsibility to complete the departmental proceedings with the greatest despatch and submit his report to the appropriate authority. Normally, the maximum period for which an officer can be kept under suspension is six months and, as within this period final orders have to be passed, it would be reasonable to expect the Police Officer concerned to put in his defence within two weeks. These limits are only meant for general guidance and are not being taken as absolute limits. If the accused Police Officer, for some substantial reason, applies for extension of time to enable him to put in his written statement, the Inquiring Authority, if he is satisfied that the application is reasonable, may grant further reasonable time to put in his written  statement.  If,  on  the  contrary,  the  Inquiring  Authority  considers  that  the application should be refused on the ground that it is made for the purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice, he may, after recording the reasons in writing, reject the application and call upon the accused Police officer by a written notice, to put in his written statement within such further date, as may be specified in such notice. 

355\.1 If, on the receipt of the written statement of the accused Police Officer, the Inquiring Authority finds that the accused Police officer has pleaded guilty to the charge or charges, he shall conclude the inquiry and draw up his findings. 

355\.2 If the accused Police Officer fails to acknowledge the receipt of the memo of charge or does not offer his explanation within the time specified, the inquiry will be proceeded with on the presumption that the accused officer has no explanation to offer. 

**Inspection of Documents by the Accused Police Officer** 

356\. The Inquiring Authority should give every reasonable facility to the accused Police  Officer  to  inspect  any  documents  or  records  necessary  for  the  purpose  of preparing  his  defence.  Such  inspection  should  be  arranged  in  the  presence  of  a responsible police Officer to ensure that the records are not tampered with in any manner. The documentary evidence in the custody of the accused should be produced by him along with his written statement. If it is produced later, the Inquiring Authority may  admit  or  reject  it  in  his  discretion.  Normally,  such  evidence  should  not  be rejected  unless  it  has  the  effect  of  unnecessarily  prolonging  the  inquiry  and  the accused Police Officer has not offered a reasonable excuse for not having produced the evidence earlier. Documents and records not referred in the memo of charge but which the accused Police officer considers relevant should be made available to him, unless there are special and valid reasons for not doing so. If any particular record has been  withheld,  the  reasons  for  doing  so  should  be  recorded  in  writing  in  the proceedings  file  and  also  communicated  to  the  accused  officer  in  the  form  of  a separate order, a copy of which, with the accused officer's acknowledgement, should be kept in the proceedings file. 

**Provision to be Heard in Person** 

357\. If, within the prescribed time, or such further time as the Inquiring Authority may give, no written statement in defence is filed and no request, in writing, is made for an inquiry or for being heard in person, the Inquiring authority may either record his  findings  forthwith  without  holding  any  further  enquiry,  or,  at  his  discretion, inquire into the matter further to satisfy himself about the truth of the charges. An inquiry must be held if the accused Police officer asks for it, or has expressed a desire to be heard in person, or having regard to the written statement in defence or the statement made by the Police Officer himself when he is heard in person, a further inquiry is necessary to decide the truth of the charges. 

357\.1 Except in respect of very straightforward cases, the Inquiring Authority will always  find  it  useful  to  examine  the  accused  Police  Officer  concerned  orally, irrespective of whether the accused Police Officer desires to be heard in person or not. If  the  accused  Police  Officer  refuses  to  submit  for  any  reason  a  list  of  defence witnesses  with  his  written  statement,  he  will  not  be  precluded  from  citing  his witnesses during the inquiry. 

**No Appearance by Lawyers** 

358\. An accused Police officer may, if he desires, present his case with the assistance of another serving police officer or a retired police officer. Lawyer should not be permitted to appear in enquiries for the accused police officer or against the accused police officer. If the retired police officer is also a legal practitioner then the police officer shall not engage such a person unless the presenting officer appointed by the disciplinary  authority  is  also  a  legal  practitioner  or  the  disciplinary  authority  or specially empowered authority as the case may be, having regard to the circumstances of the case. 

358\.1 All  orders  passed  permitting  or  rejecting  the  assistance  of  a  Police  Officer should  be  communicated  in  writing  to  the  accused  Police  Officer  and  his acknowledgement obtained. A request for the assistance of a Police Officer can only be made at the time of submission of a reply to the memo of charge and the accused Police Officer shall be bound by such orders as the Inquiring Authority or a superior Police Officer may make in this behalf and no appeal lies against such orders. The period spent by the officer permitted to assist the accused Police Officer should be treated as on duty and should be paid T.A. admissible to him according to rules. 

**Regular Start of the Proceedings** 

359\.  Thereafter,  the  Inquiring  Authority  should  fix  a  date  of  first  hearing  of  the inquiry, which should be communicated in writing to the accused Police Officer and others  required  for  the  inquiry.  When  the  accused  Police  Officer  appears  for  the inquiry on the date of first hearing, the Inquiring Authority should put the following questions, and the answers, should be recorded in writing in the 'proceedings' file : 

1) Have  you  received  a  copy  of  the  charge  memo  with  a  statement  of  the allegations? 
1) You have submitted a written statement in reply to the memo of charge. It has been taken on record. 
1) Have you understood the charges ? 
1) Have you any objection to my holding the inquiry against you ? 
1) Have you anything else to say before I proceed with the inquiry ? 

359\.1 The answers must be read over (and translated, if necessary) to the accused officer, and his signature and that of the Inquiring Authority appended to it. The following certificate should be written at the end of each set of questions and answers: "Recorded by me, read over (and translated) to the deponent and acknowledged by him to be correct". 

359\.2 When an accused Police Officer who is on leave fails, without sufficient cause, to obey a written order requiring him to attend the inquiry on a specified date, he will be liable to have his leave cancelled. It is incumbent on the accused Police Officer whether he is under suspension or on leave, to leave his address in the District Police Office and the officer conducting the inquiry and also communicate any change of address. Any orders intended for the accused Police Officer will be sent to the address furnished by him, and it is, therefore, his responsibility to see that he makes proper arrangements to receive such communication. If he claims that he was unable, on account of ill-health, to attend the inquiry, his claim will be rejected, unless it is supported by a medical certificate value.  In such a case, the Medical Officer should be asked to state clearly whether the accused Police Officer is not in a condition to attend the inquiry. If the accused officer absents himself without leaving his address, 

he should be struck off as a deserter. If he has left his address, notice giving the date 

of hearing should be served on him personally under acknowledgement or sent to him by registered post, acknowledgement due. If he does not receive the communication, or having received it, does not attend the inquiry without giving adequate reasons, the inquiry should be held ex parte. 

**Recording of Evidence** 

360\. At the inquiry, evidence should be heard on charges which are not admitted or which, though admitted, the Inquiring Authority desires to investigate. The inquiry, however, should not extend to matters not mentioned in the memo of charge. The evidence in support of the charges should be recorded first in the presence of the accused Police Officer and then the accused Police Officer be given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses. At the head of each statement, the name, father's name (or husband's name), age, occupation and address of the witness should be entered and in the case of an official witness, his name, rank and number (if any) or designation should be written. 

360\.1 The evidence of each witness should be recorded in the form of a narrative in the  first  person  and  when  the  evidence  is  completed,  the  accused  Police  Officer should  be  called  upon  to  cross-examine  the  witness.  If,  as  a  result  of  cross- examination,  any  doubts  are  raised,  the  Inquiring  Authority  may  re-examine  the witness for clarification and if, as a result of such re-examination, any new matter is introduced, the accused Police Officer should be afforded an opportunity to further cross-examine the witness with reference to the new matter. If the accused Police Officer says that he has no cross examination or refuses to cross-examine, a record should be made thus 'Cross-Examination Nil' or 'Declines to cross-examine’. 

360\.2 Thereafter, it should be read over to the witness and, if necessary, explained to him in the language in which it was given. If the witness denies the correctness of any part of the evidence when it is read over to him, the Inquiring Authority may either carry out the correction or instead of correcting the evidence, make a memorandum of the objection and add such remarks as he thinks necessary. 

360\.3 In a joint inquiry where there is more than one accused Police Officer, each of such accused Police Officer should be afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses examined in support of the charge. In a joint inquiry where there is more than one accused officer, an accused Police Officer should be given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses of a co-accused officer if the evidence of such a witness supports the charge levelled against the accused Police Officer. 

360\.4 At the foot of the completed deposition including cross-examination of each witness,  the  following  certificate  should  be  written  and  signed  by  the  Inquiring Authority,  the  witness  and  the  accused  officer.  "Recorded by  me,  read over  (and translated) to the deponent and acknowledged by him to be correct". If there is more than one page of deposition, the pages other than the last should also be initialed by all the parties mentioned, preferable below the last line, if space is available. 

**Documents to be Taken on Record** 

361\.  Documents  in  support  of  the  charges  should  be  marked  in  red  ink  in  a conspicuous place and marked as Exhibits P-l, P-ll, and so on. They should be kept in a separate file with an index showing the particulars in brief of each exhibit, the witness who produced it and its page number(s) in the file. The Inquiring Authority may also put in documents and evidence, if he considers it important, to find out the truth. Such exhibits will be indicated as : Exhibit by Inquiring Authority - Ex. C.I, II, III, and so on. (C-indicating court). 

361\.1 After taking all the oral and documentary evidence in support of the charge and the case for the prosecution is closed, the Inquiring Authority should put the following questions to the accused Police officer and record both the question and the reply of the accused Police Officer in his very words in the 'Proceedings' file : Q. 1. You have heard the evidence of the witnesses against you. What have you to 

say?  

2. Have you any witnesses to be examined in your defence?    
2. Do you wish to produce any documents in your defence? 

361\.2 He must be given a reasonable time to draw up and present a list of witnesses and documents. The Inquiring Authority can  question him  for what purpose each witness  is  required  so  as  to  avoid  protraction  of  the  inquiry  by  the  citation  of unnecessary witnesses. Normally, the request to call an official witness should not be rejected. When, however, it appears that the request is frivolous or vexatious and that it is made with a view to unnecessarily prolong the inquiry and that the facts which he is expected to speak to (according to the statement of accused) are not relevant for the purpose of inquiry, the request should be refused. The reasons for refusing to call a witness (official or private) should be recorded in writing and communicated to the accused Police Officer and his acknowledgement obtained. Failure to do this will vitiate the inquiry. 

**Defence Witnesses** 

362\.  Defence  witnesses,  styled  'D.Ws',  are  thereafter  examined-in-chief  by  the accused Police Officer and cross-examined, if necessary, by the officer leading the evidence and also by the Inquiring authority, but not by other witnesses to the inquiry, however much they are impugned.   The accused Police Officer may re-examine such of  the  defence  witnesses  as  he  considers  necessary,  after  which  the  Inquiring Authority may again question the defence witnesses further.  If the accused Police Officer makes a written or oral application for permission to examine himself as a witness  in  his defence, the  application should be  granted  and  the accused officer examined as a defence witness. Defence exhibits should be marked in red ink as D-l, D-ll, and so on. 

362\.1 If, in spite of reasonable opportunity afforded to the accused Police Officer for adducing  defence  evidence,  he  fails  to  adduce  such  evidence,  it  is  open  to  the Inquiring  Authority  to  conclude  the  inquiry  on  the  basis  that  the  accused  Police officer has no defence evidence to produce. 

362\.2 If the accused officer dispenses with any of the defence witnesses or documents cited by him, this fact should be recorded in the 'Proceedings' file under the signatures of the accused officer and the Inquiring Authority. Copies of such evidence as are required by the accused Police Officer may be permitted to be taken by him. 

**Attendance of Witnesses** 

363\. The officer holding the inquiry has no power to enforce the attendance of any non-official witness. As regards official witnesses, he should be able to procure their 

presence either by writing to them direct or to their superior officers at appropriate 



|levels. Normally, the request to call an official witness, when his evidence is relevant,|
| - |
|should not be rejected. When, however, it appears that the request is frivolous or|
|vexatious or it is made with a view to prolong unnecessarily the inquiry, the request|
|should be refused and the reasons thereof recorded in writing. In all cases where the|
|Inquiring Authority feels that the evidence of an official witness is relevant for the|
|inquiry whether called at the instance of the accused Police Officer or at his own|
|discretion, the expenditure should be borne by Government. In all other cases where|
|the Inquiring Authority feels that the evidence of a particular witness is not relevant|
|for the inquiry but is called at the instance of the accused Police Officer, the expenses|
|of such witnesses should be borne by the accused Police Officer. Before asking such a|
|person to appear before him as a witness, the Inquiring Authority should require the|
|accused Police Officer  to deposit the  necessary  expenses  with him.  If he  fails  to|
|deposit the amount, the Inquiring authority may decline to summon the witnesses and|
|examine them. |
||
||
|**Responsibility of the Inquiring Authority** |
||
|364\. It is the Inquiring Authority's responsibility to arrive at the truth or otherwise of|
|the charges against the Police Officer, on the evidence brought on record during the|
|inquiry. For this purpose, it is his responsibility to put whatever questions that may be|
|considered necessary both to the witnesses examined in support of the charge and to|
|the witnesses produced by the accused Police Officer. |
||
|**Submission  of  Another  Written  Statement  by  the  Accused  Police**|
||
|**Officer** |
|365\.  The  Police  Officer  charged  shall,  if  he  so  desires,  put  in  a  further  written|
|statement in his defence and also explain his defence orally to the Inquiring Authority|
|after all the evidence both for and against the charge has been heard. If the accused|
|Police Officer forthwith files a written statement it should be taken on the inquiry file.|
|If, on the contrary, he applies for some more time to file a written statement, the|
|inquiry should be adjourned to a date not later than 7 days within which time the|
|accused Police Officer should file his statement. If he fails to do so, it is open to the|
|Inquiring  Authority  to  conclude  the  inquiry  on  the  basis  .that  the  accused  Police|
|Officer has no such statement to file in his behalf. |

366\. **Precautions for Inquiring Officer** 

1. The  officer  holding  the  inquiry  must  be  strictly  impartial.  It  is  particularly important that the formalities prescribed in the statutory rules and orders should be followed. It is essential that the conduct of the proceedings should be such as to inspire a belief that the inquiry is being conducted in an impartial and a detached manner. 
1. Inquiry should be completed with as little delay as possible. Care should be taken to avoid all dilatoriness, and adjournment or postponement of the inquiry should be  allowed  only  when  absolutely  necessary.   Where  an  officer  is  suspended pending an inquiry into his conduct, it is all the more necessary that the inquiry should be completed with expedition and orders passed as early as possible. 
1. If, at any state, in an inquiry, the accused Police Officer declines or expresses his unwillingness to take part in the proceedings before the Inquiring Authority, the said  Authority  is  entitled  to,  and  should  proceed  with  the  inquiry  ex-parte,* conclude it upon the materials placed before him and record his findings. 

**Drawing up of the Inquiring Findings**  

367\. On completion of the inquiry including the personal examination of the accused Police Officer, if any, as the case may be, the Inquiring Authority shall record his findings  which  will  be  known  as  minute  in  respect  of  each  charge,  with  reasons thereof. A minute shall be written in all cases. The minute will be written under the following heads :  

1) statement of the charge(s)/statement of allegations or brief facts of the case ;  
1) summary of the prosecution evidence ; 
1) summary of the defence evidence ; 
1) a memo of the points urged by the Police Officer concerned during the personal hearing, if any ; and 
1) findings on each charge or charges.  

367\.1 No reference to the demeanour of witnesses should be made in the minute unless a note was made in the records at the time of the inquiry in this regard. This is necessary to ensure that the Inquiring Authority, who frames the minute, does not speak about the demeanour of witnesses merely from memory. The summary under items (b) and (c) of the minute should contain only so much of the evidence on record as is essential for the adequate discussion of the facts in issue. 

367\.2  The  finding  on  each  charge  should  be  recorded  separately  after  careful consideration of the evidence adduced for and against it. Where there are several charges, 

367\.3 the Inquiring Authority should deal with each charge completely, analyse the evidence  in respect of  each  charge  and come  to  the  conclusion as  to whether  he considers a charge is proved or not, before passing on to the next charge. A full and final summing up will be given at the end, covering all the charges. 

367\.4 When only a part of a charge is proved by the evidence on record or a charge is proved in a modified form, it shall be recorded accordingly, detailing the extent to which  or  the  form  in  which  the  charge  is  held  to  be  proved.  When  it  becomes necessary to record findings on charges different from those originally framed, the Inquiring  authority  may  record  findings  on  such  charges  provided  reasonable opportunity has been given to the accused Police Officer to defend himself by way of cross-examination and by adducing other defence evidence in respect of such charges. 

**Forwarding the Inquiry Report and the Minute** 

368\. The Inquiring Authority should forward the minute and other records of inquiry with a covering letter through the proper channel to the authority competent to award the penalty, which should be treated as confidential. He will also send the service register and personal file of the accused officer, if they are in his custody; otherwise, the officer through whom the records are sent to the competent authority should attach the service register and personal file in original, if they are with him. The authorities through whom the records of inquiry pass may also add their remarks on the covering letter. 

368\.1 Along with the covering letter, a statement showing the following particulars of the accused Police Officer should be prepared and enclosed: 

1) Date of   birth. 
1) Date of enlistment. 
1) Length of service. 
1) Substantive rank. 
1) Date of promotion to present rank or grade. 
1) Pay in the substantive grade or rank. 
1) Pay in the present grade or rank. 
1) Date of next increment due. 
1) Number of monetary rewards and Good Service Entries. 
1) Number of punishments: Major & Minor. 

**Systemization of the Inquiring Record** 

369\. The inquiry records should be sorted and arranged in four files as under:  

1) **File No*.* One :** File No*.* One called the "Proceedings File" should contain the following records: 
1) Order-sheet. 
1) Acknowledged copy of the suspension order, if the accused Police Officer has been placed under suspension pending inquiry. 
1) Acknowledged   copy   of   the   order   (or memo) of the Disciplinary Authority , appointing the Inquiring Authority to conduct the inquiry. 
1) Acknowledged copy of the memo of charge. 
1) Written  statement  of  the  accused  Police  Officer  submitted  in  reply  to  the memo of charge. 
1) First oral statement of the accused Police Officer recorded on the   first day of the hearing of the inquiry. 
1) Statements   of   witnesses   recorded   in   support   of   the   charge(s)   including cross-examinations and re-examinations, etc. 
1) Oral statement of the accused Police Officer recorded after examination of the witnesses in support of the charge(s).  
1) Statements of witnesses examined in defence including cross- examinations and re-examinations, etc., if any. 
10) Documents in support of the charge. 
10) Documents in support of the defence, if any. 
10) Oral statement of the accused Police Officer recorded, after the examination of witnesses in defence.  
10) Further written statement of defence, if any, of   the accused Police Officer.

   **Provisional Conclusion** 

   370\. The authority competent to impose punishment shall examine the minute along with the records of the inquiry and record its provisional findings on each charge giving reasons therefore. Thereafter it shall come to a provisional conclusion in regard to the penalty to be imposed. 

   **Second or Further Opportunity to the Delinquent** 

   371\. Where the penalty proposed is of major nature, the person charged should be supplied with a copy of the report of the Inquiring Authority and be called upon by the competent authority or such other officer authorised by it in this behalf to show cause within a reasonable time, not ordinarily less than one week, but not exceeding one month, against the particular penalty proposed to be inflicted.

   **The Final Order** 

   372\. The final order containing the decision of the authority competent to impose the penalty should be a self-contained order. The order should set out briefly the relevant facts, findings of the Inquiring Authority; Disciplinary Authority's decision thereon with reasons in brief for any departure from the findings of the Inquiring Authority and it should be signed by the Disciplinary Authority. 

   372\.1  In  the  case  of  punishments,  other  than  compulsory  retirement,  removal  or dismissal from service, the Disciplinary Authority should also pass orders releasing the accused Police Officer from suspension, if he is the appointing authority. If he is not  the  appointing  authority,  then  he  should  refer  the  matter  to  the  appointing authority, with a copy of his final order, requesting him to release the accused Police Officer from suspension and to give him a posting.

Similar action shall be taken in respect of all punishments including judicial awarded to senior Police Officers. 

   **Appeals**  

   374\. Appeals must be accompanied by a copy of the minute and a copy of the order appealed against. No appeal shall be entertained if it is not preferred within the time limit prescribed in Rules. The period intervening between the date of application for a copy of the minute or any other material forming the contents of the appeal and the receipt thereof by the appellant may be excluded from the calculation of the time limit for appeals. A Police Officer is entitled statutorily to only one appeal against any order imposing a penalty on him. 

   **Records to be Sent With Appeals** 

   375\. Every appeal shall be forwarded to the appellate authority with an expression of opinion and with remarks on each paragraph of the appeal in regard to the accuracy of the  statements  made  and  inferences  drawn.  In  forwarding  appeals,  the  records connected  with  the  order  appealed  against  and  records  of  inquiry  in  the  case  of penalties  of  dismissal,  removal,  compulsory  retirement  or  reduction  should  be 

   forwarded to the appellate authority, together with a copy of the appellant's defaulter 

   sheet and confidential personal file sheet. However, the records of the inquiry and defaulter sheet need not be sent with time-barred appeals. The appellate authority will call for them if he requires them. A certificate that the copy of the minutes furnished by the appellant is genuine should also be sent. 

   375\.1 When an appeal is presented, the appellate authority should first satisfy that the requirements of the Disciplinary Proceedings Rules have been complied with. If there are  any  procedural  defects  to  occasion  prejudice  to  the  appellant  or  causing miscarriage of justice, the case should be returned to the authority which passed the original order,  

   375\.2 If the procedural defects are of a minor nature which could not have caused miscarriage of justice to the appellant, the appellate authority may dispose of the appeal on its merits, but it will specify the irregularities in its order and state why they have been disregarded. The appellate authority will consider ; 

1) whether the facts on which the order was based have been established ; 
1) whether the facts established afford sufficient ground for inflicting punishment ; 
1) whether  the   penalty  is  excessive,   adequate  or  inadequate; and if it thinks necessary may require the authority passing the order to make further inquiry on any point or points specified and shall then pass such orders as it thinks just and proper, including the enhancement of any punishment given, or the awarding of a more severe punishment; 

375\.3 Provided that a punishment shall not be enhanced, or a more severe punishment awarded in appeal,   unless   notice   to show cause   against such   enhancement or more severe punishment, as the case may be, has been given and any cause shown thereon considered. 

375\.4 In   cases   where   Police   Officers are reinstated in service, after suspension, compulsory retirement, removal or dismissal from service, specific declaration as to whether the previous service rendered by the Police Officers counts for pension or not, should be recorded in the service Book and attested by the Head of the office.  375.5 When an admissible appeal is submitted to the Government, all the evidence, documentary  and  oral,  which  forms  part  of  the  record  of  the  inquiry  should  be submitted with the appeal, together with the remarks of the Director-General on the points raised in the appeal. 

376\. **Revision** 

1. The State Government shall alone have the power of revision. The Director- General may, in respect of punishments which are appeal-able, call for the records of the case on his own motion or otherwise to satisfy himself about the propriety or correctness of an order passed and if he is of the opinion that the order  passed  is  improper,  he  may  forward  the  proceedings  to  the  State Government with his report containing recommendation for revision. 
1. Similarly, a superior Police Officer in respect of punishments inflicted by an officer subordinate to him call for records and if, on a perusal of the records, he is of the opinion that the order passed is improper, he may forward the proceedings to the Director-General through the official channel for a review by the Government. 
1. Any Police Officer who is aggrieved by the orders of the appellate authority may prefer a revision petition to the Government within three months from the date of the order of the appellate authority. 

**Reinstatement and Payment of Arrears**  

377\. In cases where an order of dismissal, removal or compulsory retirement passed by the competent authority is set aside in appeal or revision or under an order of court of  law  and  the  Police  Officer  is  reinstated  in  service  on  grounds  of  equity,  the questions as to what pay and allowances should be allowed for the intervening period and whether or not the period should be treated as duty will be dealt with under Rules. 

**Non-Appealable Punishments**

378\. The following punishments which are not appealable may also be imposed on Assistant  Sub-Inspectors,  Head  Constables  and  Police  Constables  and  officers  of corresponding rank : 



|**(i) Punishment drill** |
| - |
|**(ii)  Extra guard duty** |
|**(iii) Fatigue   & other duty** |

378\.1 An Inspector or a Reserve Inspector or an officer in charge of the District Armed Reserve or any superior officer may award the above punishments. When the order of punishment drill, extra guard, fatigue duty or other duty is passed by an officer below the rank of Commandant, it shall not exceed 7 days. These punishments may be imposed after a summary enquiry in the orderly room. 

**Register of Punishments** 

379\. All the Superintendents and Unit Officers will maintain a register of punishments in which will be entered the details of all the inquiries instituted against the Police Officers in their charge. 



|**Chapter 19** |
| - |
||
|**Police Stores, Arms, Ammunition and Equipment** |
||
||
||
|**Introduction** |
|380\.  The  Para-military  organisation  like  police  is  always  in  the  need  of  constant|
|supply and support of various items and articles for their professional and functional|
|existence.  Establishment  of  police  stores  at  various  levels,  therefore,  becomes  a|
|functional need and a basic pre- requisite for their operational modalities. Central|
|store at the PHQ level, regional stores at regional level, district stores at the district|
|level and local stores at other levels, thus, become essential points of procurement,|
|supply, collections and distribution of various items like clothing, tents, arms and|
|ammunition, vehicles and different types of aids, equipment and operational articles. |
||
|**Indenting and Supply of Stores** |
|381\. The** articles of stores, clothing and equipment will be purchased by the Police|
|through  the  Central  Stores  Purchase  Organisation  or  through  other  recognised|
|agencies. The requirements in respect of articles to be purchased will be referred to|
|the Central Stores Purchasing Officer,** who will call for tenders and in appropriate|
|cases also make negotiations with various contractors and obtain samples of articles|
|from them. After complete examination of the tender samples by the Central Stores|
|Purchasing Officer, there will be a joint scrutiny of the samples by the representatives|
|of the Central Stores Purchasing Committee. The DGP will communicate the samples|
|approved by him to the Central Stores Purchasing Officer, who will place orders for|
|the  articles  required  with  the  contractors  whose  offers  and  samples  have  been|
|accepted. Contractors will then supply the articles direct to the Superintendents of|
|Police concerned.|
||
|**The Procedure** |
|382\. After the tenders are invited, the specifications of the articles required must be|
|adhered to, and if any change in them becomes inevitable, fresh tenders should be|
|invited. The Central Stores Purchasing Officer will send the approved bulk supply|

samples where necessary to the indenting officer *i.e.* the Inspector-General of Police who in turn will send the same to the concerned officers for the purpose of checking up the stores when supplied by the contractors. For this purpose, if the indenting officer has any doubt, he will make an immediate reference to the Central Stores Purchasing  Officer  to  depute  his  inspecting  staff  in  order  to  check  up  the specifications on the stores in question. 

382\.1 In** respect of those articles which are purchased as per the Indian Standards Specifications, samples will not be sent by the inspecting authorities to the indenting officer or the consignees. 

**Size Statements** 

383\. On receipt of the annual indents from the Districts/Units, the DGP will do the allotment  of  various  articles  to  each  District/  Unit.  After  the  allotment  order  is received, the officers concerned will send the size statements, wherever necessary, to the DGP/Superintendent of the Jail concerned/Welfare Centre or any other recognised agency, as the case may be, immediately. 

**Articles received by Railway** 

384\. Officers taking delivery of goods at Railway stations should examine thoroughly and weigh carefully in the presence of the goods delivery clerk all consignments before accepting them. Should any tampering with the parcel be noticed or should the actual weight of the parcel not tally with that given in the Railway receipt, this fact should at once be brought to the notice of the responsible Railway official and a signed certificate giving the exact description and weight of the package concerned obtained  from  him.  This  certificate  will  support  any  further  representation  to  the consignor or facilitate the claim from the Railway. 

384\.1 The consignee should ask for open delivery whenever the outer packing  is damaged; or whenever such open delivery is considered necessary by him and the same is possible under the rules of the Railway Administration. While taking delivery, the extent of any loss, destruction or deterioration should be noted by the consignees in the delivery books of the Railways, giving full details of such loss, destruction or 

deterioration. A copy of the remarks noted by the consignee in the delivery book 

should  be  obtained  from  the  Station  Taster.  As  soon  as  possible  after  any  loss, destruction or deterioration is notified in the case of open and/or partial delivery, and in the case of non-delivery immediately after the expiry of the time when the goods should have ordinarily arrived at the destination; and in every case within six months from the date on which the goods were delivered to the Railway Administration for being carried.  

**Supply-Examination Committee** 

385\. Whenever a consignment of stores of any description required for the department is received, it will be inspected by a committee presided over by the Superintendent of Police or Dy.SP consisting of the following members:- 

1. One Inspector 
1. One Sub-Inspector, and 
1. Incharge Store 

**Samples** 

386\. A cupboard should be specially kept at the Head quarter for all clothing samples, which should be neatly folded and looked at from time to time to see that they are in good order, with the seals and labels intact. Inside the shutter of the cupboard, a list of contents should be affixed which should be a copy of the list of samples received from the DGP. The samples are always taken on the Stock Registers as they form part of the supply for which an order is placed. Whenever a new consignment of the same article is  received,  the  sample  in  the  cupboard will  ordinarily be  replaced by  the sample  received  with  the  new  consignment  unless,  of  course,  the  transaction  in respect of the old sample is not complete. In the former case, the sample removed from the cupboard should be issued, and in the latter case both the old and new samples will continue to be kept in the cupboard. 

**Accounting for Articles Received** 

387\. All articles received must be accounted for in the appropriate parts of the stock accounts. 

**Marking of Articles** 

388\. All articles of clothing and accoutrements on issue are numbered in oil paint or by imprinting, with the policeman’s number and date of issue. The date of original issue should invariably be maintained. 

**Life of Uniform and Other Articles Supplied to the Constabulary** 

389\. The minimum periods for which uniform and other articles supplied to Head Constables  and  Constables  from  the  clothing  grant  should  ordinarily  last,  the prescribed  period.  The  periods  specified  are  the  minimum  periods  during  which articles must last. If any article of a man's kit becomes unfit for wear in less than the period specified, its replacement should be made following the procedure prescribed.  

390\. **Disposal of Condemned Clothing and Accoutrements** 

1) The power of condemnation and disposal of all time expired and unserviceable articles of clothing and accoutrements issued to men has been delegated to the Sub- Divisional Police Officers with regard to men in their respective Sub-Divisions, and to the Police Inspector in respect of men not coming under the control of any Sub- Divisional Police Officer. As regards swords, the power has been delegated to the Superintendent of Police. 
1) Unserviceable articles of clothing that are really worn out and will fetch little when old will not be taken away from the men, but will be allowed to be used by the men for private wear, subject to the following:— 
1) All condemned uniform which is capable of being made use of in Government interests is to be withdrawn. 
1) Shirts, shorts and   fatigue caps are to be used as fatigue suits for the use of working parties. 
1) Carpets should be   sewn   together as jajams* for subordinate   offices. 
1) All leather - accoutrements should be used for repairs of boots and other leather articles. 
1) Unserviceable   socks    should be    burnt. 
6) Ordinarily,  Jerseys,  boots  and  haversacks  should  be  retained  by  the  men,  but Superintendents are al liberty to withdraw them if they can otherwise make good use of them. 
6) The best among condemned chevrons may be kept for wear with fatigue dress worn by Head Constables. 
6) Time-expired unserviceable kit boxes after being condemned should be sold and the proceeds credited to Government. 
3) The  condemned  clothing  articles  other  than  woolen  and  those  allowed  to  be retained by the Police-men as per sub-rule (2)* above should be sent to the Range Central Motor Transport Workshop instead of selling them by auction. 
3) Accoutrements, other than leather accoutrements, swords and scabbards, when worn out, will be sold and the sale proceeds credited to Government. 
3) Whenever unserviceable articles of uniform are given to the Police or are sold, all buttons, detachable numbers, district letters, chevrons, etc. should be removed there from. 
3) When a man leaves the force on pension or otherwise, he will give up the articles supplied  to  him  at  Government  cost.  The  Superintendent  of  Police  has,  however, discretion to permit those who retire on pension or gratuity or proceed on long leave preparatory to retirement to retain such articles of clothing as are, in the opinion of the Superintendent, not fit for re-issue. 
3) Jamadars who are permitted to wear uniform after retirement should be allowed to retain one set of clothing articles comprising their first kit. 
3) Police Officers on leaving the force should be required to hand over articles of clothing at the Police Station to which they are attached and not be called on to pay the expenses of conveying them to Head** quarters. 
3) Head Constables, on promotion to the grade of Police Sub-Inspectors, in which case uniform articles are to be provided at their own expense, should return all the uniform articles supplied to them from the clothing grant. 

   391\. **Stock Position of Uniform Articles** 

1) In order to ascertain the actual   stock position of clothing and accoutrements in all the districts, the Superintendents of Police should send to the DGP with a copy to the concerned Inspector General of Police, before 5th of every month, information in the prescribed form. 
1) The Superintendents of Police should   specify the   surplus   stock position   in the remarks column of the prescribed monthly    statement so that the Inspector   General of Police   may   transfer   certain items of such   surplus   stock to the needy districts/units. 

   **Source of Supply of Ordnance Stores** 

   392\. Arms, ammunition and other ordnance stores including component parts of arms, bayonets, armourer's tools, lubricants, cleaning material, respirators, etc. required for the use of the Police will be supplied by the Ordnance Department. Ordnance Stores consist of stores of all description supplied by the Director of Ordnance Services. Army Head-quarters, New Delhi, including guns, machine guns, small arms, etc., and materials for repair and preservation allowed by the Regulations for the equipment of the  Army  including  small  arms,  light  automatics,  machine  guns,  rifles,  muskets, bayonets,** pistols, revolvers, etc. 

   **Annual Indents and Forecasts of Requirements in Ordnance Stores** 

   393\. The supply of ordnance stores may be required for two purposes :- 

1) For normal maintenance; and 
1) For meeting extraordinary demands due to additions to the force or the creation of new organisations. 

393\.1 In order that the supply of ordnance stores may be made economically, without administrative inconvenience and as per scale, the annual  firm demand for one year and the  forecast demand for the subsequent two years are prepared in the office of the Inspector General of Police on the strength of quarterly returns received from the 

districts/units  after  taking  into  consideration  the  stock  position  of  the  arms   and ammunition and also increase in strength on or before the 31st of March each year. 

394\. **Instructions for the Preparation and Submission of Indents** 

1) In  all  indents  for  arms  and  ammunition,  the  correct  description  of  the various types of arms and ammunition must be strictly adhered to. 
1) For the correct nomenclature of other ordnance stores, the Vocabulary of Army Ordnance Stores, Indian Addendum, should be consulted. 
1) Requisitions for Army and Indian Army Forms should be forwarded direct to the 2nd Deputy Controller of Printing, Forms, Stores, 166 Dharamtala 

Street, Calcutta, for compliance. (4) Demands for ammunition should be for not less than 100 rounds for any type of ammunition. (5) Indents for arms and ammunition should be prepared in quardruplicate. (6) Full  consignment  instructions  (viz.  nearest  Railway  Station,  name  of Railway,  designation  of  consignee,  Head  of  charge,  etc.)  should  be furnished in respect of every indent. (7) Indents  for  Ordnance  stores,  other  than  arms  and  ammunition,  will  be submitted annually. 

**Purchase of Armourer’s Tools** 

395\. Superintendents of Police are empowered to purchase from sources other than the Ordnance Department armourer’s tools not authorized by the “Equipment Table of the Civil Police and Jails”, subject to the condition that the cost of the tools ordered can be met from the budget grant of the year concerned. 

396\. **Disposal of Surplus or Unserviceable Ordnance Stores** 

1) **Method  of  disposal  :**  Ordnance  Stores  issued  on  payment  which  become unserviceable, will be disposed of at the discretion of the head of the department concerned. Local sale will, in most cases, be the most profitable method of disposal. If, however, it is desired to return any stores to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps for disposal,  I.A.F.Z./2098  (in  duplicate)  should  be  forwarded  to  the  nearest  Chief Ordnance Officer showing in details the unserviceable stores it is desired to return. The Chief Ordnance Officer will use his discretion in allowing the return of any, or all, of the stores reported for disposal. 
2) **Disposal of sale proceeds :** The sale proceeds of stores disposed of locally in accordance with para (i) will be retained by the department concerned. Credit for Stores returned voluntarily to the Indian Army ordnance corps for disposal will be allowed by the Army at the  actual sale of scrap value (or in cases where this is inconvenient at a rate to be assessed by the Chief Ordnance Officer, not exceeding their approximate sale or scrap Value) of the articles returned less expenses incurred in breaking the articles up or preparing them for sale. 
2) **Freight charges :** Freight charges on stores voluntarily returned will be prepaid by the consignor. 

   397\. **Issue of Ammunition for Private Practice** 

1) Ammunition  required  for  private  practice  should  be  issued  from  Head Quarters stores, the cost being recovered from the officer concerned at the rates quoted in the voucher, and credited into the treasury. 
1) It is permissible to issue, on payment, to all Police Officers of and above the rank of Head Constables 50 rounds of revolver ammunition per annum for practice purposes. A strict check should be maintained on the ammunition so issued and measures taken to ensure that it is completely expended on practice. 

398\. **Care of Arms**  

1) Hammer protectors for revolvers may be obtained on indent. When in use, the protector should be adjusted in the proper position. In order to adjust the hammer protector in that position, the revolver should be cocked (care being taken that there are no cartridges in the chambers) and the protector then slipped on to the hammer to the base of the striker. The hammer should then be lowered gently, when the protector will be found in the proper position. The revolver may then be loaded in the usual way. All officers armed with revolvers should be instructed in the use and manner of adjustment of the protector. 
2) Arms  in  charge  of  the Police  are generally  kept  in  clean  condition  except as regards the actions, which get clogged and dirty owing to want of proper cleaning and lubrication. The actions should, where possible, be stripped, cleaned, overhauled and oiled monthly; otherwise they clog and are liable to give misfires, non-extractions and other  failures  causing  an  unnecessary  expenditure  of  components  in  repairs. Moreover, that part of the barrel which is imbedded in the stock fore-end requires lubricating half-yearly with a mixture of 1/2 kg of bees wax to one pint of lubricating oil and unless this is done, the barrels rust and eventually become unserviceable from deep external corrosion. 

   399\. **Special Inspection by Armourers**  

1) The inspection year is from April 1st to March 31st. 
1) 100 per cent inspection of the arms of the Police will be carried out in a period of three years. 100 per cent inspection of one-third of the arms of each district/unit will be carried out annually. 
1) Special inspection of all units will be carried out on request. 
1) Inspections will be carried out by a team consisting of one Assistant Inspector of Armourers and two Armourers. 

400\. **Instructions for the Storage of Ammunition** 

1) “Ammunition in sealed boxes” means ammunition in boxes with the factory or Arsenal seal intact, or in open boxes if the tin lining is unopened and has obviously not been tampered with or, briefly, ammunition in a hermetically sealed box which has not been opened since leaving the factory or Arsenal. 
1) "Loose ammunition"* means ammunition other than that held in sealed boxed, e.g., cartridges carried in pouches or stored loose in boxes etc. 
1) Where no proper magazine is available, cartridges may be stored in any sub- stantially constructed building, or in any room, cupboard or other compartment in such a building, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:— 
1) The "place selected" must be free from easily inflammable materials, and must be subject to no undue risk of fire. Provided that these conditions are fulfilled, it is not necessary that the "place selected" should be detached from other buildings. 
2) The building must be weather proof and be kept dry. 
2) The "place selected" must be in charge of a responsible person, be kept scru- pulously clean and devoted exclusively to such storage. 
2) The safe custody of the ammunition must be provided for at all times and the officer in charge of the Head quarters will be responsible that the places selected are suitable in all the above respects. 
4) Boxes containing ammunition will be raised at least fifteen centimeters from the floor by means of battens or other suitable supports. 
4) The boxes should be arranged according to date of manufacture (the latest being at the bottom and oldest at the top) and stacked headers and stretchers, each stack being a few inches away from its neighbouring stack. Boxes must be stored away from the wall. 
4) The service and practice ammunition should be stacked separately. The oldest ammunition should always form the practice stock. Ammunition for training should be included in practice stock. 
4) To prevent deterioration of ammunition, care must be taken to exclude damp from the place of storage and the minimum number of boxes only opened at one time; loose ammunition must be kept at a minimum. 
4) Turnover will be carried out in the following order :- 
1) The contents of broken boxes, *viz.,* boxes, the tin linings of which have been opened, and loose rounds. 
1) Boxes of ammunition on which the words "Examined (year)" are enfaced on the lables, in order of date of examination. 
1) Other   ammunition the oldest dates being used first. 
9) Whenever fresh stocks are received they should be placed in the service stock and the oldest ammunition from service stock should be transferred to the practice stock. 
9) Where service ammunition must be held loose, ready for use *(e.g.,* guards, during emergency etc.), it should, as far as possible be of the latest date of manufacture available  from  the  service  stock.  For  this  purpose  a  few  boxes  of  latest  date  of manufacture from the service stock should be kept aside. 
11) Loose ammunition referred to above should be turned over at least once annually and  replaced  by  new  ammunition  from  sealed  boxes,  the  old  ammunition  being expended at the earliest opportunity. 
11) No explosives,  other than Government  Police  ammunition received  from  the Arsenal or Government ammunition for the rifles of members of the I.T.F., should be kept in the Police magazine. 
11) Ammunition  belonging  to  the  Excise  Department  may  be  kept  in  the  Police magazine at every district Head Quarters on the conditions that:— 
1) the ammunition  boxes  are  properly sealed by the Excise Officer who deposits or removes from time to time any ammunition.  
1) the   Police     are   responsible for the safe custody of the boxes only and are in no way concerned    with the contents thereof, and 
1) the Excise officer will apply for access to this Excise ammunition at reasonable times in direct consultation with the Officer incharge of the Head Quarters. 

   401\. **Examination and Test of Ammunition**  

1) Ammunition in sealed boxes may* be considered fully serviceable up to five years from the date of its manufacture, provided that the boxes have not been subjected to bad storage conditions. If cartridges of the same date of manufacture as ammunition held in sealed boxes have been expended in practice during the previous 12 months and  have  functioned  satisfactorily,  all  ammunition,  held  in  sealed  boxes  may  be regarded as serviceable irrespective of age. 
1) Ammunition over five years old which has not been used for practice during the previous 12 months pr ammunition in boxes which appears to have been subjected to bad storage conditions will be examined and tested. 
1) To do this a sample box from each make and date of manufacture on charge will be opened and the cartridges examined for deterioration. This is indicated by verdigris or other signs of corrosion on the case or round the cap chamber or by rust on the base disc of rolled case cartridges. The latter should be tested also by thumb pressure for any weakness in their attachment to the case. Forty rounds will then be fired from a serviceable rifle or musket into a bank of earth or other safe place to test for misfires, hang fires, pierced caps, bursts etc. In the case of rolled case cartridges, difficulty in extraction, due to the base disc coming off will be regarded as a serious defect. Splits at the mouth may be ignored, unless the number is high or their severity is such that they extend down below the shoulder of the case. 
4) The ammunition will be dealt with as below on the result of this examination and test:— 
1) If the visual condition of the ammunition appears good and the cartridges function satisfactorily at the above firing test, it should be regarded as serviceable. 
1) If the visual condition is good but the ammunition fails at the firing test a re-test should  be  carried  out  with  another  serviceable  musket  or  rifle.  If,  at  this  re-test, failures  occur  again  and  the  weapon  is  above  suspicion,  the  ammunition  will  be regarded as unserviceable.  
1) If at the visual examination, marked signs of verdigris are noticed around the cap or, in the case of rolled case   cartridges, the base disc becomes loose or falls off on thumb pressure; the ammunition should be regarded as unserviceable. ' 
1) The result of the examination and test of the ammunition from the sample box covers the remaining ammunition of the same make and date, unless there is reason to think that the box is not representative of the whole. In this case discretion must be exercised  as  to  what  further  test  will  be  necessary  to  eliminate  boxes  containing unserviceable ammunition. 
5) Boxes of ammunition of the same make and of dates of manufacture with not more than one month between extreme dates may be regarded as one group for the purpose  of  this  examination  and  test.  The  number  of  boxes  in  any  one  group, however, should not exceed about 20 boxes. 
5) Loose ammunition* should be examined periodically. The frequency of the exami- nation  will  depend  on  local  conditions,  storage  and  the  handling  etc.  which  the ammunition has been subjected to.  
5) The examination and test will be as follows:— 
1) Loose rounds, except those obviously unserviceable due to deterioration or exces- sive handling, of the same make and year of manufacture will be treated generally as one group.  
2) If a large number of rounds are held and some obviously have been subjected to worst treatment than others, it may be necessary to divide them into several groups, a test being carried out from each separate group. 
8) In any case of doubt the advice of the Chief Ordnance Officer at the nearest Arsenal  should  be  requested.  This  Officer  will  arrange  for  any  inspection  or  test necessary to be carried out. 
8) The breaking up of ammunition locally   is forbidden. 

   Any ammunition found defective should be returned to the nearest Ordnance Depot or Arsenal for break-up under expert supervision. 

   402\. **Loss of Arms and Ammunition**  

1) It  is  essential  to  maintain  the  closest  possible  check  over  losses  of  arms  and ammunition,  and  a  committee  of  three  members  should  usually  be  appointed  to investigate cases in which arms or ammunition have been lost. The members of the committee might ordinarily be a Magistrate, the Superintendent or a Sub-Divisional Officer  and  an  Inspector.  In  places  where  three  members  are  not  available,  the Ordnance Department will accept the certificate of the Superintendent of Police that a committee of the required number or even of two Officers could not be convened. 
1) It is not necessary to hold committee proceedings in connection with the loss of empty paper cases of blank cartridges or component parts of arms such as screws. 
1) When metal blank ammunition cases have been lost in circumstances that call for no  detailed  investigation  (e.g.,*  during  skirmishing  or  ceremonial  parades),  the Superintendent of Police should attach to his requisition for fresh blank ammunition a certificate to the effect that the circumstances in which the missing cases have been lost have been investigated to his satisfaction and that there is no objection to their being written off. 
1) Committee proceedings held over the loss of arms and ammunition should be submitted in type and in duplicate in form.  

   **Arms and Ammunition** 

   403\.  The  armament  of  the  Police  consists  of  303  rifles,  110  muskets,  automatic weapons and pistols and revolvers. The arms of the headquarters force are kept in the armoury of the quarter guard. A guard of one head constable and four constables is posted for the protection of the armoury, magazine and store room. The keys of the armoury, magazine and store room should be kept by the Reserve Inspector in his own possession, in district headquarter lines and by the Subedar in sub-divisional headquarter lines. The Reserve Inspector in district headquarter lines and the Subedar in sub-divisional headquarter lines are responsible that the arms are kept securely and in good condition. The day before each fortnightly inspection parade all the arms in the  armoury  must  be  thorougly  cleaned.  A  fatigue  party  of  recruits  and  men undergoing punishment drill should be put on for the purpose. A register of arms is maintained under the direction of the Reserve Inspector in district headquarter lines and the Subedar in sub-divisional headquarter lines. All weapons will be branded on the stock with a serial number which will be entered in the register. The number of each weapon given out for guard or escort duty and the name of the officer to whom it is issued will be recorded in the lines diary.

||
|**Transfer and Relief of Officers** |
||
||
|**Introduction** |
|408\. Transfer and postings are integral parts of administration. These are effective|
|tools of providing continuity and change to an organisation. They are essential for the|
|meaningful survival and organisational effectiveness. Transfer and postings are also|
|the  important  methods  of  HRD,  innovation,  motivation  and  proper  utilisation  of|
|manpower in any organisation. These methods should be used keeping in mind the|
|basic principles involved in their execution. Transfers and postings should not be|
|done too frequently nor should an individual be allowed to stay on a particular posting|
|for unduly long period of time. Transfers and postings should always be affected in|
|the public interests and for the organizational well being. |
||
|**Postings and Transfers in Police Organisation** |
||
|409\. Postings and transfers of Police Officers are regulated by the Government under|
|statutory provisions and guidelines issued from time to time. The Government has|
|powers of transfer of all Officers. These powers have been delegated, to the extent|
|considered appropriate to the Officers at various levels. The general policy of the|
|transfer is that no officer should be transferred within a stay of 3 years on a post|
|without valid reasons and should not be retained at a particular post for more than 5|
|years, and that, transfers should generally be made during summer vacation and first|
|week of the month and that they are not used as a punishment, that the vacancies in|
|rural and remote areas should not be left unfilled, and that personal preferences of|
|employees  should  be  accommodated  subject  to  administrative|
|requirements/convenience and the suitability of individual.  |
||
|**The Transfer Authorities** |
|410\. The authorities empowered to order transfers and postings of various levels of|
|Officers in Police Department are given below: |

2. SP in charge of Districts or other Unit Heads of equivalent rank in respect of all officers of ranks of Sis, ASIs, HCs and Constables within the Unit. The SDPOs should have power to transfer Constables in their jurisdiction. 
2. The Government is the Cadre controlling authority for IPS in the State. All proposals of postings, deputations, training etc. of IPS officers shall ordinarily be initiated by DGP as Head of Police Department and the Government would issue appropriate orders on his proposals. However, nothing will preclude the Government from issuing such orders, as deemed fit, directly. 
2. All authorities with powers of transfer shall comply with the policy guidelines of the Government and the Department with regard to transfers as stipulated from time to time. 

**Reports of Relief of Gazetted Officers**

413\. **Postings and Transfers of Non-Gazetted Officers** 

1. Postings  and  transfers  of  members  of  the  Police  Subordinate  Service  are regulated by the Police Subordinate Service Rules and guidelines framed by the Govt. from time to time. According to these rules and guide lines, all transfers  and  postings  of  subordinate  police  officers  shall  be  made  by  the appointing authority or by an authority to whom the appointing authority is administratively subordinate, but transfers can be made by the SsP within his jurisdiction and by the DPC in respect of Police Communications Branch. The Director-General  of  Police  has  the  authority  to  transfer  and  post  all subordinate Police Officers any where in the state on administrative grounds and in public interest, except permanent inter-zonal transfers. 
1. The Zonal IG/DIGP is empowered to transfer Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors, SIs. RSIs within the range. But as posts of RIs of Armed Reserves are Multi-zonal posts, the Director General of Police and Addl. DGP Administration on his behalf will order their transfers. 
1. The SP in the Districts, the CP or DCP authorized by the CP in the Cities may transfer Sub-Inspectors, Head Constables and Constables within the district or within their jurisdiction. 
1. The  Sub-Divisional  Police  Officer  may  transfer  Head  Constable  and Constables from one police station to another within his jurisdiction, but he must report all such transfers to the Superintendent of Police, giving reasons. 
1. Transfers of Inspectors and Reserve Inspectors should be communicated to the Director-General  of  Police  for  publication  in  the  Police  Gazette.  Sub- Divisional Officers transferring Constables in their Sub-Divisions should send the  original  orders  to  the  District  Police  Office  for  the  issue  of  necessary District Orders. 
6. The Commissioner of Police may transfer directly recruited Sub-Inspectors of the City Unit on their completion of their induction training, to the Districts for practical training and also for experience in Police work for a period of 3 years and to fill up the vacancies in the City Police by transfer of direct recruit Sub-Inspectors with sufficient experience from the Districts in consultation with the Zonal IsG/DlsGP concerned. 

414\. **Points of Consideration for Transfers** 

1. Officers of and above the rank of Sub-Inspectors should not, as far as possible, be allowed to serve in the districts in which their homes are situated or in which  they  or  their  near  relatives  have  landed  property  or  other  vested interests. 
1. Head Constables and Constables should not be posted or allowed to serve in the Taluqs/Mandals in which their homes are situated and in which they or their near relatives have landed property or other vested interests. 
1. Mutual transfers of Head Constables and Constables may be affected from one district or unit to the other by the Government. Travelling Allowance will not be admissible in cases of mutual transfers made on request. The personnel have to forego their seniority in the respective ranks in parent units and take last  rank  among  the  approved  probationers  of  the  unit  to  which  they  are transferred.  They  are  required  to  give  an  undertaking  to  this  effect.  Mere willingness  of  the  two  persons  for  mutual  transfer  does  not  automatically entail their transfer. The Government shall use its discretion in acceding to such requests and should recommend inter-District transfers only under rare circumstances, after ensuring that the Presidential Order on local cadre is not affected. 

415\. **Transfers not to be Frequent** 

1. Frequent  transfer  of  personnel  is  forbidden.  The  Zonal  Inspectors-General DIsGP/Commissioners of Police shall ensure that needless transfers are not made.

Where an officer has to be transferred earlier owing to exigencies of pubic service, special reasons shall be recorded in the file and a copy of the order of transfer together with a note on the special reasons shall be forwarded to the immediate official superior to the officer ordering the transfer. 
2. As  regards  transfers  of  officers  ordered  by  the  Government  on  the recommendations  of  the  Director-General  within  the  three-year  period,  a statement showing the special reasons for the proposed transfer and the period for which the officers concerned has served at various places during the three years prior to the date of transfer proposals, should be furnished. 
2. No Police Officer, except Constables (Civil) should be retained in the same place for more than three years. No Constable (Civil) should be retained in the same place for more than five years. However, in Public interest, if it is found necessary to deviate from this order, in any case, specific sanction should be obtained in advance from the Director General of Police in case of Officers of the rank of Inspectors, from the Zonal IsG/CPs/DlsGs in the case of officers of the rank of Sis and below and from the Government in the case of officers of and above the rank of DSsP and above.

1. Constables  and  Head  Constables  under  orders  of  transfer  should  be relieved in the first week of the month immediately after they receive their pay and directed to join their new stations not later than the 15lh to enable drawal of pay etc. in the new station for the month and eliminate need for advances  and  supplemental  claims.  This  procedure  shall  be  followed except in very special cases where transfers are ordered to be given effect immediately. 

**Joining Time** 

418\.  Joining  time  may  be  granted  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Fundamental Rules. It must be understood that joining time cannot be claimed as a right and that any officer may be directed to join without availing himself of full joining time.  

419\. **Relief of Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors**

Budget sub-heads under which the budget estimates are submitted are also shown in the Budget Manuals. 

422\. **Monthly Statement of Expenditure**  

1) In  order  to  ensure  that  the  amount  allotted  to  each  disbursing  officer  is  not exceeded  without  permission,  the  controlling  officer  should  call  from  each subordinate officer for a statement of his expenditure for the month and his total expenditure  up-to-date.  This  statement  must  be  despatched  by  the  subordinate disbursing officer on the 10th of the  month following that to which the accounts relate. The statement will be prepared, so far as contingencies .are concerned, from the figures recorded in the contingent registers maintained by the disbursing officer and, in regard to other items, from the treasury slips attached to bills when sent to the treasury  for  encashment,  which  contain  complete  account  classification  of  the respective items of expenditure.  
1) The orders regarding the noting of account, classification on the bills and the nomenclature to be adopted in referring to various classes of expenditure should be meticulously  followed  and  the  utmost  care  and  accuracy  must  be  exercised  in supplying these figures, as any difference between the figures compiled in the DGP’s office from such returns and the figures posted in the Accountant General's registers from  the  vouchers  received  with  treasury  accounts  will  lead  to  avoidable  and troublesome correspondence. 
3) When bills are endorsed for payment at Sub-treasuries after the 25th of a month, they are incorporated in the district treasuries in the next month. In such cases the amounts  of  the  bills  which  are  actually  cashed  and  incorporated  in  the  District Treasuries in a particular month should alone be included in the statement of that month in consultation with the Treasury Officers. 

   423\. **Refund of Unspent Balances**  

1) Superintendents of Police are responsible in respect of their own and subordinate Police offices for seeing that unspent balances of grants which lapse with the close of the financial year and all other moneys that require to be refunded are remitted into the treasury on 31st March. 
1) No money should be withdrawn from the treasury, unless it is required for imme- diate disbursement. It is not permissible to draw advances from the treasury either for the prosecution of works the completion of which is likely to take considerable time or  for  preventing  the  lapse  of  budget  grants.  The  following  irregularities  must, therefore, be strictly avoided :- 
1) The drawing of money, in advance of requirements to save a lapse of grant. 
1) The payment for goods before the firms with whom orders are placed are in a position to deliver them. 
1) The holding of undisbursed money not needed for actual requirements. 
1) The certification that detailed bills for previous months had been furnished, when no such bills had actually been prepared on the date of drawal of money. 
3) These irregularities are attended by many risks. They tend to set up a vicious circle. The accounts are inflated by exaggerated figures of expenditure leading to excess budgeting, which in turn leads to extravagance in expenditure, and the evil effect is cumulative. 
3) Police  Officers  should  not  issue  orders  sanctioning  disbursement  of  money towards the close of a financial year, unless there is a reasonable chance of its being spent before the end of the year. 
5) It is the duty of all disbursing officers to watch and liquidate betimes their liabili- ties to other departments entitled to charge for public services rendered or for articles supplied by them, to avoid lapse of grants sanctioned for the purpose. 
5) It  is  the  duty  of  controlling  officers  of  the  departments  receiving  supplies  or services  from  other  departments  to  see  that  all  debits  are  raised  by  the  serving departments and adjusted in the accounts of the year to which they relate. If the debits are not received within a reasonable time, the matter should be taken up with the serving departments and vigorously pursued. This will avoid large saving in the final grants  of  the  receiving  department  owing  to  the  delay  in  the  receipt  of  debit  for supplies and services. 
5) The procedure of obtaining a large quantity of stamps or other supplies towards the close of a financial year, in excess of probable and reasonable requirements up to the end of the year, is opposed to the spirit of financial rules, and must be strictly avoided. 
5) An unusually large proportion of various grants is spent in the last month of the financial year. This is objectionable and must be avoided. All officers should consider the state of their grants carefully and, where expenditure is necessary for *bonafide* reasons, should order what they want, as far as possible, in November and arrange to pay for it before the end of January. 
5) It should be noted that accounts are kept open beyond the 31st of March for the definite purpose that as far as possible all the transactions of the year may be entered in the accounts of the year; but it is not essential that transactions relating to earlier years should be booked in the accounts of the latest year which are still open. If it is impossible to have any expenditure booked in the accounts of the year to which it relates owing to the fact that the actual incidence of the expenditure is under dispute, it ought to be charged to the accounts of the year in which the final decision is taken, though at the same time all possible efforts should be made to expedite the decision as far possible. On the other hand, adjustments should not be made in the accounts of the past year, if the disbursements could not have been reasonably anticipated in time for a grant being obtained from the proper authorities. This implies that when demands (original  or  supplementary)  for  appropriation  of  the  necessary  amounts  for expenditure are being placed before the Legislature, suitable provision should always be made for anticipated liabilities, and the provision that adjustment should not be made in the previous year's expenditure in certain circumstances should not be used as cloak to conceal the results of defective budgeting. The onus of providing that the disbursements  could  not  have  reasonably  been  anticipated  should  lie  on  the controlling officer. In all cases where the expenditure could have reasonably been anticipated, as for example, recurring payments from one Government or department to another and payments which though not of fixed amount are of a fixed character, the Accounts Officer will automatically make the adjustment in the accounts before they  are  finally  closed.  Superintendents  of  Police  should  strictly  observe  these instructions. 

   **Quarterly Statement of Expenditure** 

   424\.  The  DGP  will  submit  to  Government  in  the  Finance  Department  quarterly statements of actual expenditure incurred by all the offices under his control during the  quarter.  All  the  disbursing  officers  should  furnish  the  requisite  information regarding progress of expenditure to the DGP before the 10th of the month following the quarter to which the accounts relate. 

   **Account Procedure** 

   425\. The following account related procedures should be strictly complete with 

1) **Form of payment of government dues :** Departmental receipts are ordinarily be realised in currency notes, cheques payable on demand including crossed cheques, remittance transfer receipts and demand drafts. Officers of Government may accept in payment of Government dues or in settlement of other transactions, cheques, which must invariably be crossed, of only those banks which have a clearing account with the Reserve Bank or the State Bank of India. Final receipt will be granted, not when the  cheque  is  tendered,  but  when  it  is  cleared.  A  register  of  cheques  and  drafts received should be maintained in the prescribed form. 
1) **Receipt  to  be  passed  for  every  payment  :**  Government  servants  receiving moneys on behalf of Government must give the payer a receipt. This receipt should be signed only by a responsible officer, who should satisfy himself at the time that the amount has been entered in the Cash Book. Receipt books should be used in all cases and the blank receipt books should be kept in the safe custody of the officer who issues them. Receipts for all sums exceeding Rs. 100 except those given by or on behalf of Government must be stamped with a Revenue stamp of one rupee. 
3) **Issues of duplicates or copies of receipts, etc. :** No Government servant may issue duplicates or copies of receipts granted for money received or duplicates of copies of bills or other documents for the payment of money which has already been paid, on the allegation that the originals have been lost. If any necessity arises for such a document, a certificate may be given that on a specified day a certain sum on a certain  account  was  received  from  or  paid  to  a  certain  person.  This  prohibition extends only to the issue of duplicates on the allegation that the originals have been lost, and does not apply to cases in which, according to special provision, duplicates are prepared and tendered with the originals. In the case of a bill or deposit repayment voucher, passed for payment at a treasury but lost before encashment or payment, the officer who drew the original bill or voucher should ascertain from the treasury that payment has not been made on the original before he issues a duplicate, which should bear distinctly on its face the word "duplicate" written in red ink. 
3) **Payment through a Messenger :** Whenever a messenger is deputed to cash a bill at a bank or treasury the dated signature of the messenger should be taken on the bill or letter of authority, as the case may be, in the presence of the officer deputing him. The  treasury  official  should  first  compare  the  officer's  signature  on  the  letter  of authority or on the bill, as the case may be, with the specimen signature in the treasury and secondly compare the messenger's dated signature taken in his presence with the signature  on  the  letter  of  authority  or  on  the  bill.  If  both  these  signatures  tally, payment may be made or the bill may be made over for being encashed at the bank. If they do not agree, the bill may be returned with a statement of objection to the officer concerned directly and not through the messenger. 
3) **Expenditure and payment of money:** (1)** No authority may incur any expendi- ture or enter into any liability involving expenditure or transfer moneys for investment or deposit from Government account unless such expenditure or transfer, as the case may be, has been sanctioned by general or special orders of Government or by any authority to which power has been duly delegated in this behalf. 

   (2)  Every  Government  servant  incurring  or  authorizing  expenditure  from  public moneys  should  be  guided  by  his  high  standards  of  financial  propriety.  Every Government servant shall also enforce financial order and strict economy at every step and see that all relevant financial rules and regulations are observed by his own office  and  by  subordinate  disbursing  authorities.  Among  the  principles  on  which emphasis is generally laid are the following:- 

1) Every Government servant is expected to exercise the same vigilance in respect of expenditure incurred from public moneys as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of expenditure of his own money. 
1) The expenditure should not be prima facie* more than the occasion   demands. 
1) No authority should exercise its powers of sanctioning expenditure to pass an order which will be directly or indirectly to its own advantage. 
1) Expenditure  from  public  moneys  should  not  be  incurred  for  the  benefit  of  a particular person or a section of the people, unless:- 
1) a claim for the amount could be enforced in a court of law, or 
1) the expenditure is in pursuance of a recognised policy or custom. 
5) The amount of allowances granted to meet expenditure of a particular type should be so regulated that the allowances are not on the whole a source of profit to the recipients. 
6) **Account  classification  of  certain  miscellaneous  receipts  :**  The  following   miscellaneous receipts should be credited to '055 Police Miscellaneous-Other items : 
1) The sale proceeds of worn-out articles of Police clothing, and sums recovered from the  men  on  account  of  articles  supplied  in  substitution  of  those  damaged  or  lost through  culpable  negligence,  whether  the  articles  in  question  were  originally purchased during the current year or in a previous year. 
1) Miscellaneous recoveries, such as sale proceeds of condemned dead stock articles, rents of Police building and lands, sale proceeds of litter of Government horses and grass  grown  on  Police  lands,  cost  of  strychnine  powders  recovered  from Municipalities  and  ammunition  issued  to  Police  Officers  on  payment  and  other receipts which cannot conveniently be taken to other heads. 
1) Recoveries for Ordnance stores returned by the Police Department. 
1) Fees for examination of documents received by Photographic and Handwriting Experts. 
5) Recoveries of the recoverable expenditure on account of messes and canteens from the Policemen. 
7) **Loss of Government Money :** (1) Public money in the custody of the department should be kept in strong treasure chests and secured by two locks of different patterns. In the absence of any precise orders from Government, the officer in charge of the chest  should  make  such  arrangements  for  the  custody  of  the  key  and  the  proper disbursement of all money as he considers requisite. All the keys of the same lock must be kept in the same person's custody and, as a general rule, the keys of the one lock should be kept apart from the keys of other locks and in a different person's custody, when practicable. When there is a Police guard, the officer in charge of the guard should usually be the custodian of one set of keys. The chest should never be opened without both custodians being present. The officer in charge of the guard should always be present when a treasure chest is opened and until it is again locked. Whenever  a cashier  is  attached  to  an  office,  the keys  of one of  the  locks of  the treasure chest will necessarily remain in his possession. 
2) If considered desirable, the duplicate keys of the cash chest may be placed, under the seal of the officer in charge, in the custody of the Treasury Officer. In the event of this practice being adopted, a duplicate key register should be maintained, and once a year, in the month of April, the keys should be sent for, examined and returned under fresh seal, a note being made in the register that they have been found correct. 
2) Heads of Offices should check up the existing arrangements obtaining in their offices for safety of Government money which they are required to handle or keep in their custody, see that the rules laid down by Government in that regard are observed scrupulously, ensure that accounts relating to all transactions of Government moneys pertaining to their Offices are maintained and checked properly and regularly and that the various rules laid down and orders issued by Government from time to time with a view  to  minimizing  the  risk  of  embezzlement,  misappropriation,  theft  etc.,  of Government money or property, are followed rigidly and invariably. 
8) **Responsibilities for losses :** (1) Every subordinate authority shall realize fully that he will be held responsible for any loss sustained by Government through fraud or negligence on his part and that he shall also be held personally responsible for any loss arising from fraud or negligence on the part of any other Government servant to the extent to which it may be shown that he contributed to the loss by his own action or negligence. 
2) The cases of loss should be reported immediately to the Audit Officer so that assi- stance  can  be  obtained  in  regard  to  the  technical  investigations.  The  subordinate authorities should also inform the Administrative Departments at the earliest so that remedial  action  may  be  taken,  in  consultation  with  the  Finance  Department,  in rectifying  defective  procedure,  etc.  In  any  case  in  which  recourse  to  judicial proceedings appears necessary, competent legal advice should be taken as soon as this becomes apparent. In all cases, departmental proceedings should also be instituted at the earliest and concluded expeditiously in accordance with the prescribed procedure. The question of enforcing pecuniary liability should also be considered in addition to the disciplinary action that may be taken against the officials concerned.  
2) All drawing and  disbursing  officers should follow  the following  procedure  in order to minimise the risk of misappropriation, theft, etc.:— 
1) The officer concerned should invariably make a surprise check of the cash section once a month and certify that the cash balance with the cashier is in order. 
1) The officer concerned should issue instructions for the guidance of the staff in his office  dealing  with  cash  transactions  which  should  among  other  things,  specify  a panel of names of clerks and peons, who should be sent for encashing bill or credit any money into a treasury or a bank; the name or names of persons actually sent being entered on each occasion in the relevant register. 
1) A superior officer should, during periodical inspection of an office, verify as to whether the provisions of the relevant rules and the procedure prescribed under these instructions are properly observed. 
9) **Checking of cash on hand :** At the end of each month, the Head of the office should  verify  the  cash  balance  in  the  cash  book  and  record  a  signed  and  dated certificate to that effect mentioning therein the balance both in words and figures. Such certificate must be signed by the Head of the office who should invariably date the signature. 
10) **Theft or embezzlement :** (1)** (a) Except in petty cases, any loss or shortage of public  moneys,  departmental  revenue  or  receipts,  stamps,  opium,  stores  or  other property held by, or on behalf of Government, caused by defalcation or otherwise, including losses and shortages noticed as a result of physical verification, which is discovered in a treasury or other office or department, shall be immediately reported by the subordinate authority concerned to the next higher authority as well as to the Audit Officer, even when such loss has been made good by the party responsible for it. 

    (b) If the irregularity is detected by the Audit Officer in the first instance, he shall report it immediately to the subordinate authority as well as to Government, if he considers it necessary. 

2) Petty cases mean the cases involving losses not exceeding Rs. 500 each. Such cases need not be reported to the Audit Officer, unless they are, in any case, important features which merit detailed investigation and consideration. 
2) The reports should be submitted as soon as suspicion arises that there has been a loss; they should not be delayed while detailed enquiries are being made. When the matter has been fully investigated a further and complete report showing the errors or neglect of the rules by which such loss was rendered possible and the prospects of effecting a recovery, should be submitted. 
11) **Pre-Audit :** (1) Heads of Offices, before sanctioning investigation or submitting to Government proposals relating to time-barred claims, should thoroughly investigate into the delay in preferring the claims with a view to fixing responsibility and taking necessary  action  against  the  persons  found  guilty  of  negligence.  Their  proposals should invariably be accompanied by detailed report containing information regarding the action taken by them against the person(s) found responsible for the delay. 

    (2) The bills which are passed after pre-audit by the Accountant General's office are forwarded to the Treasury Officer concerned with the instructions that the payment may be made to the drawing officer on production of the audit letter or authority (number specified) either in person or with a written and duly signed application. The drawing officer can send a written application to the Treasury Officer mentioning the name of the person to whom the amount of the bill is to be paid. The application should  be  accompanied  by  the  drawing  officer's  portion  of  the  form  of  letter  of authority when payment is received at the Treasury. There is no objection, however, if the endorsements on the bills are recorded at the time of submission of the bills for pre-audit to Accountant General's office. If the drawing officers are not in a position to stick to the original endorsements they may intimate new names in the written and duly signed application referred to above. 

12) **Every payment to be supported by a voucher :** (1)** As a general rule, every payment,  including  repayment  of  money  previously  lodged  with  Government  for whatever  purpose,  must  be  supported  by  a  voucher  setting  froth  full  and  clear particulars of the claim. As far as possible, the particular form of voucher applicable to the case should be used. Suppliers of stores and others should be encouraged to submit their bills and claims in proper departmental forms. But bills not prepared in such forms should not be rejected, if they set forth the necessary details of the claims. In such cases, the additional particulars required should be added by the disbursing officer. 
2) When  it  is  not  possible  to  support  a  payment  by  a  voucher,  a  certificate  of payment, prepared in manuscript signed by the disbursing officer, and endorsed if necessary, by his superior officer, should always be placed on record. Full particulars of the claims should invariably be set forth, and where this necessitates the use of a regular bill form, the certificate itself may be recorded thereon. 
2) Cash memoranda issued by tradesmen for sale against cash payment should not be regarded as sub-vouchers, unless they contain an acknowledgment of the receipt of money from the purchaser as named therein for the price of the articles sold. 
2) Every  voucher  must  bear  a  pay  order  signed  or  initialed  and  dated  by  the responsible disbursing officer. This order should specify the amount payable both in words and figures. 
2) No payment should be made on a voucher or order, unless it is signed by hand and in ink. 
13) **Over payment and recoveries from officers :** Over-payments made to Govern- ment servants as a result of wrong fixation of pay and allowances should be regarded as a debt owed to the public and should not be recommended for being waived. All possible action should be taken to effect recovery of over-payments wherever they occur. 
14) **Payment of postage  :** (1) In payment of postage on letters and other articles, service stamps of the highest possible denominations should be used, as the use of too many  stamps  of  lower  denominations  means  extra  work  of  manufacturing  and obliterating them. 
2) All communications made by officers regarding their leave, pay, transfer, leave salary,  fund  subscriptions  and  analogous  matters  are  private  and  not  official  and should not be sent at the public expense. 
2) Police officers should refer to the Post Master before paying postage demanded as due on an official article in any case in which an alteration or erasure in the figure entry of the amount due is not supported by the signature in full of the Post Master or other duly authorized officer of the post office of delivery. 
2) To secure the proper use of service postage stamps purchased annually in every office,  it  is  necessary  to  take  account  of  the  stock  consumed  and  the  balance  at periodical intervals.  

   **GENERAL RULES REGARDING ACCOUNT PAPERS**

   426\.  Some  of  the  important  rules  regarding  accounts  papers  are  following  which should be strictly followed by all concerned 

1) **Use  of  official  designations  of  officers  in  account  papers  :**  In  all  account papers, bills, receipts, proposition statements etc., the official nomenclature of the different ranks or grades of the Police should be used.  
1) All corrections and alterations in the total of a bill whether made in words or figures, should be attested by the full signature with date of the person signing the receipt as many times as such corrections and alterations are made. 
1) Erasures  and  over-writings  in  any  bill  are  absolutely  forbidden  and  must  be avoided; if any correction is necessary, the incorrect entry should be cancelled neatly in red ink and the correct entry inserted. Each such correction or any interpolation deemed necessary should be authenticated by the drawing officer setting his dated initials against each. 
2) **Drawing  Officers'  Specimen  Signature  :**  Every  Government  officer  who  is authorised to draw cheques or sign or countersign bills payable at a treasury   shall send a specimen of his signature to the Treasury officer through some superior or other officer whose specimen signature is already with the treasury.   When such an officer   makes over charge of his office to another, he shall likewise send a specimen of the signature of the relieving officer to the Treasury officer concerned. Specimen signatures when forwarded on a sheet of paper other than the forwarding letter itself must be duly attested by the officer signing the forwarding letter. 
2) **Signing of Bills, etc. :** (1) All bills, account books and registers prepared or maintained  in  the  Superintendent's  Office  will  be  checked  and  signed  by  the Superintendent of Police himself or other Gazetted Officer subordinate to him, who is authorised to do.  
2) The  Assistant  Inspector-General  of  Police,  Superintendents  of  Police,  Special Branch or Crime Branch, Criminal Investigation Department, and Inspectors of Police in the districts have been empowered to sign all pay bills, travelling allowance bills, contingent  bills,  pension  papers,  increment  certificates  and  all  papers  concerning accounts and also to countersign all travelling allowance bills and to operate Bank Accounts, as personal assistants to the controlling officers. 
2) The Deputy Assistants to the Inspector-General of Police have been authorised to sign  for  the  Inspector-General  of  Police  all  pay  bills,  travelling  allowance  bills, contingent  bills,  pension  papers,  increment  certificates  and  all  papers  concerning accounts,  to  countersign  all  travelling  allowance  bills  etc.  and  to  operate  Bank accounts. 
2) Superintendent of Police, Head Quarters is authorised to sign for the Commi- ssioner of Police all pay bills, etc. for the staff serving under him. For the rest of staff, Deputy  Commissioner  of  Police,  Headquarters  and  Superintendent  of  Police, Administration have been authorised to sign for Commissioner of Police, the pay bills etc. 
2) In the same way, Assistant Commandants and Adjutants of all the State Reserve Police Force Groups are authorised to sign for the Commandants, pay bills etc. 
2) (a)  Rubber  stamps  are  not  to  be  used  for  singing  papers  relating  to  account matters. 

   (b) All papers concerning account matters shall be signed in ink and not with a ball pen. 

   **Account Books**  

   427\. Following are important Accounts Books which are required to be maintained meticulously, regularly and carefully 

1) **Cash Book** : (1)   The cash Book should be written as follows:— 
1) Each credit and debit entry should be numbered serially commencing from the first  day  of  the  financial  year.  The  debit  entry  should  also  show  the  consecutive number of the Cash Memo. These chalans should be filed separately according to the class. The entries in the Cash Book should be as brief as possible, as full details can be obtained at once from the respective credit and debit vouchers. 
1) Each credit and debit voucher will bear the serial number corresponding to the entry relating to it in the Cash Book. 
2) All money whether received from official sources or from outsiders should at once is credited in the appropriate Cash Book. 
2) All drafts and cheques should be similarly accounted for in the appropriate cash books before they are sent for encashment. They should be credited on the date of receipt and when they are sent to the treasury for encashment, they should be debited. When  money  is  received  on  encashment,  it  should  be  credited  and  when  it  is disbursed, it should be debited. This double entry will not be necessary if the draft or cheque is received and is cashed on the same day. 
2) If  any  money  received  represents  money  already  spent  from  the  permanent advance, it should be recouped by making an appropriate debit entry in the general Cash Book and a corresponding credit entry in the Day Book of Permanent Advance. Public  conveyance  receipts  should,  however,  be  recorded  directly  in  the  Public Conveyance Day Book. 
2) Separate Day Books will be maintained in the offices of Superintendents of Police as shown below:— 
1) Permanent Advance Day Book.  
1) Public Conveyance Day Book. 

428\. **Police Funds Cash Books** 

1) As the following funds are not concerned with "Public money" and as separate account books are maintained in the Superintendents' Offices for the same, entries of receipts in connection with them may be recorded directly in the respective account books and it is not necessary to enter them in the general Cash Book in the first instance and then to transfer them to the appropriate account books:— 
   1) Band Fund. 
   1) Sports Fund. 
   1) Watchman's Fund. 
   1) Police Club Fund. 
   1) Police Families Welfare Fund 
1) There should be only one Day Book for Police Families Welfare Fund account and all the transactions of the welfare activities (receipts and debits) should be entered in this  Day  Book  only.  However,  there  is  no  objection  if  separate  sub-accounts  for different welfare activities like Poultry Farm, Canteen, Agricultural Produce, Flour Mill, Sewing Centre, Dairy Farm, etc., are maintained by the officers to facilitate knowing the actual receipts and expenditure for a particular welfare activity and to see whether it is profitable or otherwise. All these transactions should invariably be done from the Police Families Welfare Fund Day Book. 
7) A bill endorsed on a Sub-treasury should be considered as cash transaction* in the Superintendent's office, and should be brought on the Superintendent's Cash Book on the very date on which it is received from the treasury.  
7) The actual cash received on a bill should be credited on the day of its encashment and the cash orders, drafts and cheques, on the date of their receipt from the treasury! The cash will be debited as usual according to the dates of actual disbursements and cash  orders,  drafts  and  cheques  on  the  dates  they  are  despatched  to  the  payees concerned. 
7) The balance at the end of the day should be struck and should be written in words. It is of utmost importance that the balance should be so written. 
7) The Cash Books should be closed daily even if there be no transactions. 
2) **Receipt Book** : (1) Receipt for money received from outsiders i.e., all sources other  than the  treasury,  must be prepared  at once in the  prescribed form  and  the entries being written with indelible copying pencil. 
2) Receipts for fees under the Public Conveyance Act should also be issued from a separate book.  
2) The receipt should be taken along with the Cash Book to the Superintendent or Home Inspector for signature, and if none of them is present in office, the receipt should be signed by the Head Clerk "for the Superintendent" and the credit entry in the Cash Book should be initialed. He should intimate to the Superintendent or the Home Inspector on his return to office such money transaction, and obtain his initials on the duplicate receipt voucher and against the credit entry in the Cash Book. 
2) No receipt should be passed for money received, until it is signed by a Gazetted Officer or by the Head Clerk as laid down above. 
2) (a)* The receipt books must be kept under lock and key in the personal custody of the officer, authorised to sign the receipt on behalf of the Government. 

   (b) Before a receipt book is brought into use, the number of forms contained therein shall be counted and the result recorded in a conspicuous place in the book over the signature  of  the  Government  Officer-in-charge  of  the  Book.  Counterfoils  of  used receipt books shall be kept in his personal custody. 

3) **Day Book Receipt Book :** In order to fix the responsibility on persons entrusted with money for payment into the bank, the treasury or the Post Office, or for local delivery to any person, a Day Book Receipt Book should be maintained, in which the cashier or other person delivering the money to the messenger will enter the amount of money, the purpose for which it is delivered and the date and obtain against the entry  the  dated  signature  of  the  messenger.  After  disposal  of  the  amount  the messenger will produce before the cashier the receipt or other voucher for the money, if paid, and the whole or part of the money, if it remains unpaid; whereupon the cashier will  enter the  same  in  the  Day Book Receipt  Book and  acknowledge the receipt of the same by putting his dated signature near the entry. 
4) **Bill   Register :** This   register   will be maintained for all bills sent to the treasury for encashment and must be entered in it. 
2) The Police Accountant before taking any bill for signature to the signing officer must enter in the Bill Register the serial number allotted to the bill, the nature of the bill and the amount of the bill. He will stamp on the Office Copy of the bill with a rubber stamp in the prescribed manner. 
2) The Police Accountant, when taking the bill to the signing Officer, will take with him the Bill Register. The signing Officer will then compare the amount on the bill with the amount shown in the Bill Register and initial the entry in the Bill Register. 
2) After the bill is signed, the Police Accountant will send it to the Treasury Officer along with a treasury slip for encashment or Payment order, as the case may be.  
2) On cash or its equivalent such as a payment order or drafts or cheques being received, the Police Accountant will enter the date of encashment or payment order, as the case may be, the Bill Register and bring it with the Cash Book the same day to the Officer who checks and signs it. 
2) The signing officer will compare the entries in the Bill Register with the Cash Book and place his initials on the Office copy of the bill, near the rubber stamp, in token of its being checked by him.* The Bill Register will be reviewed monthly by a Gazetted Officer who should record result of the review on the Register. 

   (8) When bills on the treasury are prepared both the office and fair copies of each bill will be put up before the Home Inspector of Police by the Accountant. The former should not sign these bills until he is satisfied that the details and the total shown in the office copy tally with those in the fair copy. He should also see that the amount appertaining to each bill is correctly entered in the Bill Register.  

5) **Incoming Bills Register :** In order that the bills received in Police offices are not delayed, an "Incoming Bills Register" should be maintained by all Police Offices. All bills received should be given serial numbers (from 1st January to 31st December every year) in the manner they are given to applications received. This will facilitate posting of entries in future in the bills register. This register should be checked every week by the Head of the local office to ensure that no bill remains pending longer than a month. Inspecting   officers   should also check   this register during their inspections and mention about it in their inspection   notes. 
6) **Token Register :** (1) In order to prevent misappropriation by persons entrusted with treasury duty of money drawn from the treasury on encashment of bills, a Token Register should be maintained in each office having transactions with the treasury. 
   2) As soon as a bill is ready for transmission to the treasury the relevant columns will be filled up and the bill then handed over to the person entrusted with the work of encashment, who will acknowledge them with his dated signature. In the course of the day, he should return the token received from the treasury to the Cashier who will fill in the Column and put his initials in. The token will be in safe custody till it is required for delivery to the person. When he takes it back, he will initial it with the date. On return from the treasury or bank in the afternoon, he will hand over the money to the Cashier and the relevant columns will be filled up.  
   2) When the register is reviewed by a responsible official, he will put his dated initials. So also will the Gazetted officer in  charge of office do either weekly or monthly, as may be convenient. 
6) **Book for Reimbursable Expenditure :** (1)** In order that the expenditure initially incurred by the State Government on behalf of various agencies such as (i) Govern- ment  of  India(ii)  other  Government  offices  (iii)  private  agencies,  etc.,  which  are subsequently to be reimbursed fully or partly may not remain outstanding for a long time , the drawing and disbursing officer should keep a separate account book for such expenditure and all such bills/vouchers should be affixed with the rubber stamp in RED-INK, with the words "Expenditure Reimbursible" on the top of the bills/ vouchers, so that such vouchers could be easily separated by the Accountant General while posting in expenditure registers. 

   (2) Such expenditure incurred should be reconciled with the figures booked by the Accountant  General  in  their  records  periodically,  and  necessary  certificate  to  that effect should be obtained from the Accountant General so that necessary consolidated audit  certificate  for  the  purpose  of  reimbursement  could  be  obtained  from  the Accountant General easily and in time and arrears will not increase. 

8) **Personal Ledger Accounts :** (1) In view of the provisions of article 284 of the Constitution  of  India,  it  is  not  permissible  to  keep  the  moneys  received  by Government servants in their official capacity outside the Government account. The article requires that all moneys received by or deposited with any officer employed in connection with the affairs of the State in his capacity as such other than revenues or public money raised or received by the Government of the State shall be paid into the public  account  of  the  state.  Personal  Accounts  within  the  public  account  should, therefore, be opened in the treasuries in respect of various funds administered.  

   (2) All personal ledger accounts like (i) Police Families Welfare Fund, (ii) Police Sports Fund, (iii) Police Club Fund, (iv) Police Band Fund, (v) Watchmen's Fund etc. should be got audited through a Chartered Accountant every year.

1) **Day Book:** (1) The Day Book should be maintained at the police station level.** 
2) Cash deposited at a Police Station by an accused person as security for his atten- dance in Court on the date fixed should invaribly be accounted for in the Police Station Day Book. 
2) In  making  entries  of  pay  and  travelling  allowance  disbursements,  the  serial numbers from the pay abstract and travelling allowance bills should be shown. This will render the abstract on the bill unnecessary and save the inspecting officer's time and labour in checking the Day Book. 
2) **Receipt Book:** (1) For all moneys received otherwise than from the treasury, receipts signed by the officer actually in charge of the Police Station, and be passed on Receipt Book. The officer signing the receipt should at the very time initial the entry in the Day Book.

3) **Credit Voucher File :** (1)   For each entry on the credit    side of the Day Book, a voucher must be kept on the credit   voucher file, arranged according to the serial number of the Day Book entries. 

   (2)   Generally, the credit   vouchers are— 

1) Cash memos, 
1) memos  for  amounts,   received    from   municipalities for killing stray dogs etc. 
1) memos,   from   Magistrates   remitting     money in recoupment of the permanent advance,

1) memos of amounts   received   at   auction sales of condemned articles etc. 
4) **Debit Voucher File:** (1) The debit voucher file should be maintained on the same lines as the credit voucher file, except that pay abstracts and travelling allowance bills will be kept in their respective files.  

   (2) All account, receipt and chalan books, vouchers, bail bond, dead stock, and lock- up  registers  etc.  should  be  kept  in  good  order  and  produced  for  audit  purposes whenever required.

All  moneys  received  on  Government account, whether in cash, cheques, cash orders, remittance transfer receipts, or bills, which are convertible into cash, shall be brought to account by appropriate entries in the registers.  

**Procedure Relating to Pay** 

430\. A pay bill is ordinarily payable at the treasury of the district in which the claim arises. The claims on account of pay and allowances of the non-Gazetted personnel should be deemed to arise at the station where the drawing and disbursing officer, who draws the claim, is stationed. 

1) **Drawing of pay for the period of absence from duty :** A Government servant who proceeds on leave after the preparation of the pay bills of his office should not in the absence of any sanction for the leave be allowed to draw duty pay for the entire month. In such a case he should be paid his duty pay and allowances, and his leave salary should be paid only when the leave is sanctioned. If there is no difference between the pay and the leave salary the Audit Office should specifically be informed of the fact indicating the period of leave, leave salary, etc., so as to enable that officer to keep notes of the period of leave on the original bill. In case there is a difference between  the  pay  and  the  amount  of  leave  salary  due  to  Government  servant,  a supplementary  bill  may  be  prepared.  If  the  latter  exceeds  the  former,  the supplementary bill should show the amount due on account of leave salary and at the same time show the refund of the amount already drawn and the difference will be claimed from the treasury or the Audit Office as the case may be. If on the other hand the amount of leave salary due is less than that already drawn, the refund of the latter to the extent of the amount claimed should be shown in the supplementary bill and the same sent to the treasury or the Audit Office, as the case may be, for audit etc. In such a case the bill in which the remaining balance of the amount still to be refunded has actually been refunded should be communicated to the audit Office. The undisbursed pay should ordinarily not be refunded into the Treasury but should be adjusted by short drawal in the bill of the next month. 
1) **Pay abstract and Muster Roll :** (1) The officer in charge of a Police Station or the Head Quarters will prepare and send to the Superintendent's office, so that it may reach there not later than the 20th of each month, one copy of the pay abstract for each of the following classes:— 
1) Sub-Inspectors. 
2) Head Constables (armed and unarmed).  ![](Aspose.Words.00a41c03-c990-408c-b25c-280b8db70daa.005.png)
2) Constables (armed and unarmed),  
2) Temporary establishments. 
2) Extra guards,         if any 
2) Watchmen 
2) These pay abstracts will be checked in the Superintendent's account office and will be returned to the officers from whom they were received, with remittance in the form of cash, a cash order or a draft as the case may be. 
2) On receipt of the remittance, the Officer concerned should arrange to distribute the pay immediately to the men present at the Police Station or Head Quarters, obtain their signatures on the pay abstract and arrange to send the pay of those men who are on leave and residing outside the station direct by money order (not through a Police Station officer of other district). 
2) For those men who are stationed at outposts, acquittance rolls should be prepared (one copy  only) for each   Outpost. 
2) The pay of men transferred between the dates of the presentation and payment of a bill should be remitted by means of cash orders/drafts, in favour of the officer under whom the men are transferred. 
2) The acquittance rolls, after being receipted by the payees, should be attached to the pay-abstract and returned to the Superintendent's office. 
2) A note should be made against the names of those men whose receipts have not been taken, either on the pay-abstract or on the acquittance roll, intimating briefly the reason for non-payment. 
2) As soon as such outstanding receipts are received, they should be forwarded to the Superintendent's office where they will be pasted on the respective pay-abstracts to which they refer. 
2) The payee's signature will not be taken on the Police Station muster roll and pay abstract. The pay abstract in this form is merely for the information of the officer in charge of the Police Station or the Head Quarters, as the case may be. 
2) The pay abstract, duly receipted, will be sent to the Superintendent's office along with the next month's pay abstract to enable the Police Accountant to verify the latter. In case any payment remains to be made, a remark viz.,* "Receipt will follow on acquittance roll" should be made against the name of the individual concerned. 
3) **Pay Bills in Superintendent's Office :** (1) The sheet clerk should on the 22nd of each month supply the Police Accountant with a statement showing the number of vacancies in each grade.  
2) The Pay abstracts received from Police Stations or Head Quarters will be checked and an abstract in English for the use of the Treasury prepared from them. An Office copy in English must also be prepared and kept in the Superintendent's account office. 
2) When leave salary on1 average pay is drawn in a' pay bill, a statement showing the calculations by which the amounts drawn on account of leave salary have been dedu- cted should be attached to the pay bill in which the leave salary is first drawn, duly signed by the drawing officer. If the calculation is based on pay drawn outside the Government servant's substantive section or office, a reference to the vouchers in 'or the office from which such pay was drawn should be given in the statement. If leave salary is based on actual and not on average pay, the drawing officer should attach to the bill a certificate that such pay is the pay of a permanent post held, substantively by the absentee at the time of taking leave. 

   **Supplementary Bills** 

   431\.  Arrears  of  pay,  fixed  allowances  or  leave  salary  shall  be  drawn  not  in  the ordinary monthly bill, but in a separate bill, the amount claimed for each month being entered  separately  with  quotation  of  the  number  and  date  together  with  date  of encashment of the bill from which the charge was omitted or withheld or on which it was refunded by deduction, or of any special order of a competent authority granting a new allowance or an increase in pay. A note of the arrear bill shall invariably be made in the office copy of the bill for the period to which the claim pertains, over the dated initials of the drawer of the arrear bill, in order to avoid the risk of the arrears being claimed over again. 

   **Payment of Pay to a Person Quitting Service** 

   432\. The last payment of pay should not be made to a Gazetted Government servant or to a Government servant whose pay is drawn on pay bill forms of a Gazetted Government  servant,  finally  quitting  the  service  of  Government  or  placed  under 

   suspension, until the Treasury Officer has satisfied himself, by reference both to the 

   Accountant General and to his own records, that there are no demands outstanding 

   against him. In other cases payment may be made without reference to the Accountant General on the responsibility of the Head of the office concerned. 

   **Contingent Bills** 

   433\. Whenever any office subordinate to the Superintendent of Police requires any article, for the supply of which financial provision has been placed at the disposal of the Superintendent, the officer in charge of such subordinate office will purchase the articles locally to the extent permitted by the orders of the Superintendent of Police, the payment for the article being made out of the permanent advance, which will be recouped by submitting a contingent bill to the Superintendent of Police. Articles not covered by the Superintendent's orders will be purchased by such subordinate office only after obtaining the previous sanction of the Superintendent, the cost being met either out of the permanent advance or out of amounts received from the Superinten- dent on submission of contingent bills for the articles concerned.

   435\. **ACCOUNT PROCEDURE RELATING TO REWARDS**

1) A Police Station Officer, who desires to make recommendations for monetary rewards  or  good  service  tickets,  should  prepare  a  recommendation  statement  and submit it to the Superintendent through the Sub-Divisional Police and also through the Circle Police Inspector when the latter has taken part in the investigation. The Circle Police  Inspector  and  Sub-Divisional  officer  should  make  any  remarks  they  think proper on the recommendation statement and the latter will forward the same to the Superintendent with the case diaries connected with the recommendations. On receipt of the statement in his office, the Superintendent of Police should deal with it without any preliminaries and record his orders thereon after verification by reference to the case diaries concerned.
