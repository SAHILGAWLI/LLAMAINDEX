# Chapter 1 Indian Police: An Introductory and Statistical Overview

# Introduction

1. Indian civilization is one of the most ancient civilizations of the world, and so are its various systems and sub systems. Accordingly, the Indian Police has a long past and has reached its present state passing through various social, political and cultural vicissitudes. The existing police system in India appears to be a unique and peculiar amalgam of various features of Ancient, Mughal and British police and policing systems. The present police system structurally and functionally owes its existing to the various Acts and Enactments promulgated by the colonial rulers. The Indian Police Act, 1861 is the basic foundation of the present day Indian Police. It is, therefore, correctly said that the present day Indian Police System, in the contemporary contexts, has become old, archaic and out-dated. There is an urgent need to replace this system. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, has therefore, issued directions to the Central Government and the State Governments to enact new Police Acts. Consequently, a Model  Police Act, has been formulated and circulated to the various State Governments, and the State governments are preparing to enact new Police Acts for their respective police organizations.

# Features of the Indian Police

2. The State List : Police in India primarily belong to the State List of the Constitution and, therefore, police, policing and various police matters basically fall into the jurisdiction of the respective State governments. Police organizations are identified by the name of the State to which they belong, and even their nomenclatures are given after the names of the respective States, i.e. Rajasthan Police, Assam Police, Bihar Police, Kerala Police etc.,etc.

2.1 Concurrent List : The police are organized, maintained and directed by the States of the Indian Union. The Indian Police System is horizontally stratified like military forces and is organized into various cadres. The police in each State are divided vertically into armed and unarmed branches.

2.2 The CPOs : There is no concept of federal police in India, though, the Central Government maintains various Central Police Organisations (CPOs). The CPOs are mostly Para-military in nature and are assigned specific nature of duties which are peculiar and specific to their operations and functioning. The CPOs do not discharge duties of civil police, but they help and assist the State Governments in exceptional cases.

2.3 The Common Parameters and the Specificity : There are quite a number of structural, functional and operational parameters, which are common to all police organizations of the country indicating the element of universality of the Indian Police. However, there are some aspects, which are specific and peculiar to each State police organization, which establish its individual existence rendering it independent and autonomous.

# Ailments & Paradoxes

3. The Police in India suffer with a variety of organizational, procedural, personnel and behavioural ailments and paradoxes. Efforts have been made to identify these ailments and paradoxes for evolving remedial measures to remove them. Various Committees and Commissions, at the State and Central levels, have been set up from time to time in these contexts. Some of the ailments and paradoxes revealed through these efforts are narrated below:

i. Colonial Stigma : In spite of their functioning in a democratic set up for more than six decades, the Indian police have not been able to wipe off the colonial stigma attached to them.

ii. Old and Archaic Blue Books : The operational and functional Blue-Books (IPC, CrPC, Evidence Acts) and even the Indian Police Act, are basically colonial in nature and in the contemporary policing contexts. Some of the provisions have become old, archaic and out dated.

ii. Poor & inadequate PCR : Police community relations in India are normally brief, contextual and even negative in nature.   
iv. Poor Image : The functional image of police in India is not satisfactory.   
v. Over Centralization : Indian Police is a functionally centralized organization and no efforts have been done to decentralize the police functions.   
vi. Over burdened organisation : There is an extra ordinary workload on an average policemen, which has adversely affected his efficiency and performance

vii. Ailments and paradoxes identified : The findings of the various committees and commissions constituted to suggest measures to reform the Indian Police have indicated that the Indian Police suffer with a number of organizational paradoxes, procedural, anomalies, personnel shortcomings and behavioural deviances which have impinged upon their performance, functioning, efficiency, image and public relations.

# The Pre-Requisites

4. Some of the pre-requisites to bring about improvement in police efficiency are following:

a) Organizational transformation b) Procedural innovations c) Personnel improvements d) Behavioural transformation e) Modernization of police f) Decentralization of police function

# a) Organizational transformation

The paramilitary, status-quoistic and colonial organization of the Indian police has to be restructured to suit the democratic and socialistic needs of free India. The feudal and alien mix of the past has to be transformed into a radical and dynamic blend of citizen police. The transformation of the alien and colonially oriented police into citizen and democratic police will make the policemen friends of the people in distress and need. The reformed and autonomous police, as friends of the people, will be able to inspire love, esteem and acceptability in the masses.

# b) Procedural innovations

The Indian police, structurally as well as functionally, happen to be an offshoot of the centuries-old enactments promulgated by the colonial rulers. The Blue Books of the Indian police are old, archaic and colonial. The very spirit of the Indian Evidence Act is full of distrust for the police. The procedural quagmire tends to make police an object of social distance and popular distrust. The Blue Books of police have to be reauthored to make the police functioning simple, fast and trustworthy. The penal and procedural police aspects will have to be reshaped according to the democratic, secular and egalitarian aspirations of the Indian people and their Constitution.

# Personnel improvements

Recruitment, training, service conditions, promotion and placement are some of the basic personnel parameters responsible for the functional adequacy or otherwise of an organization, Improper execution of these parameters is natural to cause efficiency loss in the working personnel. Administrative experiences, unsatisfactory police functioning, poor police image and inadequate community relations indicate that these personnel parameters of the police have to be viewed with a new vision to make them suitable tools for fostering cordial police-community relations. The National Police Commission has delved deep into these aspects. Their recommendations have to be implemented in toto. It will render the police efficient, democratic and humane.

# d) Behavioural transformation

Behavioural reforms and attitudinal change at the individual and department levels are required to be brought about with a view to developing professionally sound, individually courteous, functionally democratic and morally strong people to man the police organization.

# e Modernization of police

Police being a non-development department get a second-rate treatment in the financial allocation. The police department therefore should be included in the list of 'plan' departments, so that it may get due priority in the financial allocation for modernizing itself in terms of men, money, material, machines and methods. A modernized police organization will become progressive in their functioning and democratic in their behaviour.

# f) Decentralization of police functions

There has been a tremendous increase in the workload of police since Independence. Because of this workload the department has lost its perspective in the lopsided priorities. This has rendered police job complex and tense. Work overload causes delay in the timely disposal of work. This is natural to tarnish the functional image of police and obstruct their relations with the community. To improve and increase police efficiency and to decentralize police functions to ease the workload on police, various models of decentralization of police functions should be tried.

# The Challenges

7. The Indian Police face various challenges with regard to functional autonomy, operational accountability, centralization of functions, and lack of specialization and in-adequate pace of modernization. These are the basic and fundamental prerequisites for successful functioning of a police organization in a democratic society. Various efforts have been made to evaluate and analyze the factors responsible for bringing about the requisite reforms in the police department, and even concrete and well meaning recommendations of various Commissions and Committees are available to bring about the requisite improvements. Democratization, decentralization,  professionalism,  specialization,  modernization,  managementorientation and autonomy recognition are some of the methods, which can enable the Indian Police face and tackle the various challenges being faced by them. Efforts at the individual, organizational and governmental levels will have to be suitably coordinated and implemented in the right spirit for achieving the desired objectives in this regard.

# Model Police Manual: Some Perspectives

# Significance of Organizational Manuals

8. All organizations come into existence for achieving certain specified objectives. For achieving these objectives the organizations have their well-designed structures and clearly laid down functions. In order to make the structures and functions of the organizations operational and dynamic, people at various levels are recruited with requisite qualifications and capacities. In order to provide assistance, guidance and facilities in their working, the employees of an organization are given instructions from time to time. These instructions enable them to achieve the organizational objectives in a meaningful way and in an efficient manner. These instructions could be either oral or in writing. Most of the organizations make compilation of the requisite instructions and convert them into the form of manuals. The employees can refer to these manuals as and when the need arises. These manuals are termed as reference manuals, working manuals, operational manuals or technical manuals etc. etc.

# Pre-Requisite of a Good Manual

9. A good manual is a set of instructions compiled in a systematic and scientific manner. These instructions provide guideline on various subjects pertaining to the working of an organization. A manual consists of relevant, significant and universally accepted work standards, norms and values. They are so very essential for the effective and efficient functioning of an organization. The work standards, norms and values contained in the manuals are the hallmarks of functional parameters for the employees of the concerned organization. The organizational manuals work as a ready reference for the employees working at the staff and the line levels. A manual also assists the field officers in a big way for obtaining timely guidance in order to remove confusion on any issue. A manual, therefore, is a meaningful aid and assistance to employees of all levels. It provides requisite help and support to them and gives them a clear vision on various official matters. A manual, thus, is a significant tool both for the department as well as the employees working at various hierarchical levels of an organization. As a result, manuals are available in most of the civil, technical, military and police organizations. In civil organizations manuals are required for administrative purposes, whereas, in the technical organizations, they are needed as an operational necessity. Military and Para-military organizations, like army and police, need manuals in order to maintain uniformity, consistency and coherence in their work standards.

# Role and Importance of Police Manuals

10. Police are a highly interactive and dynamic organization. Policemen are required to handle situations of different nature. These situations sometimes are unpredictable being sporadic, sudden and spontaneous in nature. Policemen under all circumstances are expected to work always in accordance with the provisions of the laws of the land. In order to deal with the routine and static functions, as well as, for handling the dynamic and ever changing law and order incidents, they need to have clear and specific instructions for dealing with all these situations. In order to enable the policemen function lawfully and for discharging their various duties efficiently, it is necessary that police manuals are formulated and made available to them as a reference and guidebook during an hour of need. The instructions contained in any police manual should be able to help and assist the policemen in dealing with different issues and situations whether arising out of law and order conditions, crime management matters or any other professional demand.

10.1 A police manual is a systematic and scientifically designed treatise, which contains instructions and guidelines to be followed by all officers and men of the organization while dealing with various administrative, functional, professional and financial matters. A good police manual is a comprehensive, cogent and useful document, which consists of meaningful information on various aspects of organizational and administrative subjects. In addition to dealing with the organizational and administrative subjects, a good police manual deals with all the subjects and points pertaining to maintenance of law and order and crime management. It is an elaboration on various police duties, functions, powers and responsibilities with regard to various police units and functionaries. A police manual as a useful document includes within its format the pre-requisites like planning, welfare, aids and equipment, forms and returns along with the details on records to be maintained by various field formations and other units of police department.

10.2 Policemen of all ranks are expected to function as per the administrative norms, departmental values and legal provisions. The comprehensive police duties and their dynamic nature necessitate that instructions on all aspects of police working in the form of police manual are made available to them for an efficient and effective discharge of their duties. A police manual in order to meet with the current and contemporary needs and demands of the police organization should be revised and updated from time to time. A police manual should be well written and should encompass within its format all the points and professional aspects in order to become a working Bible and functional Gita for all functionaries of police department.

# State of Police Manuals in India

11. As part of the Research Project initiated by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) on "Preparation of Draft All India Model Police Manual" various research surveys and studies were conducted to examine the state of police manuals in India. The survey findings and the research responses have revealed that all police officers and men accept in theory the use, utility and the significance of the police manuals in the organizational and police functional contexts. But then, the critical examination of the factual situations and an assessment of the ground realities reveal that there is a huge gap in the theory and practice with regard to various aspects of police manuals in India. Table one presents this situation in a statistical manner.

Table - I   

<html><body><table><tr><td>S. No.</td><td>Factors</td><td>Satisfactory</td><td>Unsatisfactory</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Availability situation</td><td>65%</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Usability practice</td><td>30%</td><td>70%</td></tr><tr><td>c</td><td>Revision status</td><td>10%</td><td>90%</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Prioritization order</td><td>15%</td><td>85%</td></tr></table></body></html>

An examination of various parameters pertaining to police manuals like their availability, awareness about them, their usability practice, revision status and priority level indicate that the respondents assign great value and significance to all these parameters, but contrary to this, the ground realities reveal that all these parameters suffer with a state of low priority in their applied aspects, as the availability situation, awareness level, revision status and priority order with regard to police manuals were all found to be at a highly unsatisfactory level as is indicated from the information available at Table- I.

# Old, Archaic and Outdated State Police Manual

12. The information received from the various States, Union Territories and Commissioners of Police reveal that most of the police organizations in India have their own police manuals. Some of these manuals are very old and have not been revised for decades. Therefore, they have become old, archaic and outdated. A few of the police organizations do not have their own police manuals and they have adopted the police manuals of the adjoining states. A couple of states like Nagaland and Sikkim neither have their own police manuals, nor have they adopted any manual for the functioning of their police organizations. Only a few states like Andrah Pradesh and Gujrat have recently revised their police manuals. Most of the states have done no revision of their police manuals except issuing standing orders and circulars, as and when needed in this regard. The present state of police manuals in various organizations is presented at Table two.

Table - II   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Police Manuals are available.</td><td>Adopted Police Manuals are available.</td><td>Police Manuals are not available.</td></tr><tr><td>80%</td><td>15%</td><td>5%</td></tr></table></body></html>

12.1 Almost all the state police organizations feel the necessity of revising their manuals in the light of various changes and developments taking places in the sociopolitico-economic conditions and crime and criminal realities of their working environments. Revision status of various police manuals is presented at Table three.

# Table - III

<html><body><table><tr><td>Police Manuals revised during last 5 years.</td><td>Police Manuals revised during last 15 years.</td><td>Police Manuals revised during last 30 years.</td><td>Police Manuals not revised since Independence</td></tr><tr><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>15%</td><td>60%</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Why State Police Manuals are not Revised

13. Efforts were made during the field surveys to find out the reasons responsible for the inadequate and unsatisfactory state of revision of police manuals in India and the research finding have revealed that factors like old and archaic colonial Police Act, indifferent professional attitudes, failure of police leadership, impervious, academic climate of police organization and dull, dry and insipid nature of police manual work are responsible for the poor state of affairs with regard to revision of police manuals in India. The data with regard to this are available at Table-IV.

# Table - IV

<html><body><table><tr><td>S. No.</td><td>Reasons and Factors</td><td>Responsibility level</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Old and archaic colonial Police Act..</td><td>35%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Indifferent professional attitude.</td><td>22%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Failure of police leadership.</td><td>18%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Insulated and impervious academic climate of police.</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Dull, dry and insipid nature of Police Manual work.</td><td>10%</td></tr></table></body></html>

# The Anomalies and Paradoxes

14. The critical scrutiny and an in-depth examination of the available state police manuals revealed that there is no uniformity in the structures, contents, presentations, and designing of the various state level police manual. The manuals of some States are written in 6 to 8 volumes and parts, whereas, some manuals are written in 1 or 2 volumes. There is no consistency in the titles of the various volumes and the chapter scheme of the concerned volumes also suffers with lack of consistency and thematic harmony.

14.1 There is inadequate awareness among various ranks, particularly at the lower levels, regarding the existence, use and utility of police manuals. It is so because of inadequate attention given to this aspect, at the training, supervisory and operational levels.

14.2 Inadequate attention towards the importance of police manuals coupled with the unsatisfactory level of awareness about them, causes loss to the police efficiency, performance and competence. In addition to this non-revision of the manuals has rendered them irrelevant and out of contexts in the view of various changes and developments taking places in the professional working environs of the police department.

14.3 There is a near consensus on the use, relevance and significance of manuals for police organizations with an equal quantum of consensus that a model police manual at the apex level should be formulated.

# Need of a Model All India Police Manual

15. In the aforesaid backdrop of the poor state of police manuals of various police organizations, a model police manual is required for providing a uniform broad frame work, necessary uniform structure, systematic and thematic presentation along with a standard design for the formulation, revision and updating of the State Police Manuals.

15.1 A model police manual is required for evolving, developing and stabilizing some common and generic parameters for formulation/revision of police manuals so as to bring about reasonable and acceptable homogeneity and similarities among various police manuals to provide a rational to the State police organizations to be known and called as Indian Police.

15.2 In the light of the verdict of honourable Supreme Court of India all the States Governments are formulating new Police Acts for their police organizations. This would necessitate formulation and revision of the existing police manuals. A Model Police Manual in this context would serve as a ready reference and a guide to the State police organizations in the formulation and revision of their respective manuals. The Model Police Manual would provide them with the requisite professional vision and would serve as a ready checklist to test and validate the quality and standard of their police manuals.

15.3 The neglected and poor state of police manuals in India would improve significantly in, as much as, the availability of the Model Police Manual would work as a motivation and would make it convenient for all police organizations to prepare, formulate and revise their police manuals on a regular basis.

# Principles and Parameters for Formulating/Revision of Police Manuals

16. Police Manuals are essential tools for efficient and competent police performance; therefore, comprehensive, cogent, systematic and holistic police manuals should be formulated for all police organizations.

16.1 The existing state of police manuals in India is quite unsatisfactory, in as much as, they belong to a low priority area and are not reviewed, revised and updated, which makes them outdated, old and irrelevant in the contemporary professional contexts. Therefore, they should be revised and reviewed on a regular basis.

16.2 A police manual should be well written and should encompass within its format all the points and professional aspects in order to become a working Bible and functional Gita for all functionaries of police department.

16.3 The basic conceptual framework of preparation of All India Police Manual has to draw its inspiration from the basic premise that uniformed, disciplined and cohesive organizations like police, which work on the principle of esprit-de-corps, are always in the need of police manuals.

16.4 The basic and primary question while evolving the requisite conceptual framework for any police manual, whether a Model Police Manual at all India level or at State levels should be where we are and where we want to be, with what purpose, objectives, goals and aims.

16.5 The age old colonial Police Act, 1861, which has become old, archaic and out dated is being replaced with the new Police Act, and the State Governments are also formulating their own Police Acts. In the light of the new Police Acts, the existing manuals while being formulated anew or being revised should include the provisions of their respective Police Acts in their manuals.

16.6 The research findings of the BPR&D project on police manuals have revealed that the level of awareness about police manuals among various ranks is poor and unsatisfactory that is responsible for the inadequate use of the police manuals by them. In order to improve the awareness level adequate stress on the use, role and significance of police manuals should be placed, both at the training and field levels. Adequate provisions to ensure this should be made in the police manuals.

16.7 Positive, constructive and creative professional approach along with adequate and appropriate attitudes at all levels should be created to improve upon the prevailing conditions with regard to police manuals in various police organizations.

16.8 Police leaders, at all levels, should contribute significantly and bring about a qualitative, concrete and positive change with regard to preparation, revision, availability, use and utility of police manuals

16.9 The training and academic sensitivities and sensibilities of the police department as a whole should be improved so as to remove the academic insulation and professional imperviousness prevailing about police manuals.

16.10 Well-articulated, specific and time bound schemes and strategies of revision and up dating the police manuals should be evolved. This job can be outsourced to retired police officers or to some professional agency in view of the fact that the in - service police officers are not interested in undertaking the work of authoring or revising the police manuals.

16.11 A senior police officer at the police Headquarters and the committee headed by him should be made responsible for taking care of various activities, on regular basis, pertaining to police manuals.

16.12 At national level the Bureau of Police Research and Development (B.P.R.& D.) should shoulder the responsibility of coordinating, overseeing and supervising the activities with regard to writing and revision of police manuals.

16.13 The Model Police Manuals at all India level and the State Police Manuals should be prepared in the following four volumes:

(i) Organization and Administration.   
(ii) Police Duties, Powers and Procedures.   
(iii) Personnel Management.   
(iv) Forms, formats and returns etc.

# Separation of Investigation From Law & Order

89. In order to implement the recommendation of Model Police Act, 2006 for separating the investigation from Law and Order following Models could be tried. For separation of investigation from Law and Order intra and/or inter-departmental decentralization of police functions models proposed below can be tried by the State Police Organisations.

# Intra-Departmental Decentralization of Police Functions

90. As part of intra-departmental decentralization of police function for separation of investigation from Law and Order different police functions should be assigned to separate units and the execution of these functions should take place independently within the police department itself.

90.1 The main units of police such as police stations and outposts, should be concerned with their assigned primary tasks and should have sub-units, each dealing with separate functions. These units should be given functional freedom.

90.2 With this sort of decentralization of police functions for separation of investigation from Law and Order, administrative powers and authority should also be decentralized accordingly. The work of the sub-units should be properly coordinated by the in charge of the police station. The in charge of the specific unit should have the overall responsibility for the performance of his unit and he in turn should be responsible to the in-charge of the police station or the police outpost as the case may be.

90.3 For this purpose, the police station should have the following units and sub-units. The strength of the units may vary according to the work load and the nature of work in different units.

# 90.4 Intra-departmental Model for Separation for Investigation

# Model - One

# Intra-departmental Separation of Investigation from Law and Order

The functional units at the police station level

<html><body><table><tr><td>Law & order VIP & social gathering unit</td><td>Preventive detection & investigation unit</td><td>Intelligence collection unit</td><td>Special, local & minor Acts & social legislation</td><td>Emergency & relief unit</td><td>Record maintenance unit</td><td>Office & man management</td><td>PRO & reception unit</td></tr><tr><td>CI-1</td><td>CI-1</td><td>SI-1</td><td>unit SI-1</td><td>SI-1</td><td>SI-1</td><td>UDC-1</td><td>Receptionists-3</td></tr><tr><td>SI-1</td><td>SI-2</td><td>HC-2</td><td>FC-2</td><td>HC-2</td><td>ASI-2</td><td>LDC-3</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>ASI-2</td><td>ASI-4</td><td>FC-4</td><td></td><td>FC-10</td><td>HC-2</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>HC-4</td><td>HC-8</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FC-30</td><td>FC-15</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

# The Benefits

91. On the basis of the proposed Model of separation of investigation, once the work is scientifically divided and decentralized into units and sub-units, the prevailing ills of over centralization of police functions at the police station level will be reduced to the minimum and its overall impact will be healthy in as much as, it will reduce the work load on average policeman because of specificity of the job being assigned to him. Implementation of this Model will not involve any extra financial or departmental expenditure on the establishment except for increase in the manpower at the level of police station. It will be inexpensive in terms of cost benefit ratio. Despite the proposed modification, the original shape of the police organization will remain more or less unchanged.

# The Alternative

92. Another alternative model of decentralization of police functions for separation of investigation from Law and Order could be visualized in establishing extra and separate departments for the various police functions pertaining to investigation and maintenance of Law and Order. The police organization is basically meant for discharging these two important functions which are the primary tasks and responsibilities to be performed by any police organization. For these two functions two separate departments can be established, one for the maintenance of peace and order and the other for the detection, prevention and investigation of crime.

# 92.1 Inter-departmental Separation of Investigation from Law and Order

![](images/0d8bb25d537c7386520ce9d25bcc56731d6d4acdfaf935415dc980e83e534523.jpg)

92.2 Both these models can help in easing the workload of the police department, resulting in a high degree of competence and thereby causing effective and democratic community control over the police while scientifically separating the investigation from Law and Order.

# Emergency Response System

93. The Government may establish for each area notified a well-equipped Control Room with adequate communication facilities, dedicated network of patrol vehicles and other necessary wherewithal. The Control Room should be in a state of preparedness to meet any emergency situation with utmost speed and highest efficiency.

93.1 The Commissioner of Police shall prepare, and regularly update, comprehensive schemes for riot control and disaster management, inter alia, in accordance with the directions, if any, of the Government and the Director General Police.

# Police Station

# Introduction

133. Police Station is the most important unit of the police organization. It is the hub Centre of all police activities. A person, while in need and difficulty, comes to the Police Station and, thus, this is the first contact point of people with police. Police Station being an approachable point and frequently visited place by people, plays a very vital and significant role in providing relief to the people in need, and thereby, contributing in a big way in building positive image of police along with creating positive, cordial and reciprocal police community relations, which happen to be so essential for effective and efficient police functioning.

133.1 Section 2(s) of CRPC, defines police as any post of place declared generally or specially by the State Government to be a Police Station and includes any local areas specified by the State Government in this behalf. The State Government may in consultation with the Director General of Police and by notification, create as many Police Stations with as many outposts as necessary, in a police district as deemed necessary, duly keeping in view the population, the area, the crime situation, the work load in terms of law and order and distances to be traversed by the inhabitance to reach the Police Station.

# Classification

134. On the basis of geographical and demographic factors, crime conditions, law & order situations and other specific and special policing conditions, police stations can be classified into various categories. Some of these categories could be the following:

a) Mega or Metropolitan city police stations   
b) Urban police stations   
c) Rural police stations   
d) Other police stations i.e. women police station, railway police station, costal police station, traffic/road accident police station, specialized police stations

like the ones set up in crime branch, anti-corruption bureau, intelligence branch etc.

# Mega Police Station

135. In view of the rapid urbanization and fast industrialization providing variety of employment and work opportunities to the people coupled with the phenomena of migration, have given rise to the emergence of a new urban reality called Mega City/Metropolitan City. These cities have unique features, which necessitate specialized police systems for managing their crime situations, law and order incidents and other policing problems. Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Banglore, Hydrabad, Ahmedabad have been identified as Mega Cities from policing point of view. Bureau of Police Research & Development have formulated a detail Mega City policing plan (2005), which can be consulted for preparing police manuals for the aforesaid Mega Cities.

# Urban Police Station

136. On the basis of demographic and other features, the geographical areas can be divided into urban and rural areas. An urban area has large population, vast expanses of built up areas, and high density of population with floating population and migration trends. The special features of urban areas give rise to specific and peculiar offences including economic offences, organized crimes, cyber crimes, and emergence of a variety of mafia indulging into urban phenomena based crimes. In addition to the specific urban oriented crimes, there are peculiar law and order problems, which the police of urban areas are required to handle. The urban police stations, therefore, require extra, additional and specific resources in terms of manpower and other operational and functional aids, equipment and facilities.

# Rural Police Station

137. Other than the mega cities and urban towns, the remaining geographical areas can be termed as rural areas. Other than the mega and urban police stations, all remaining police stations can be termed as rural police stations. The crime incidence in these police stations is less and the law and order situations are not as complex, frequent and complicated as they are in the urban police stations. The human and the other resources for these police stations therefore could be on smaller and lesser scale as compare to the urban police stations.

# Other Police Station

138. In addition to Mega Police Stations, Urban Police Stations and Rural Police Stations, specific need and purpose-oriented police stations are prevalent in India and can the established as per the needs and requirements of the concern states. Railway Police Stations, Women Police Stations, Costal Police Stations, Mobile Police Stations etc. may be set up in the field, crime and special branch. Such police stations will fall into the category of other police stations.

# Resource Allocation to Police Stations

139. Men, material, equipment and other resource allocation to various categories of Police Stations should be made on the basis of certain specified parameters including the workload on each Police Station of the concerned category. Some of these parameters could be the following:

a) Incidence of crime and crime rate   
b) Law & order profile of the Police Station   
c) Regulatory, protocol and other miscellaneous specific jobs & tasks to be performed   
d) Traffic management & Traffic related tasks   
e) Demographic factors including population pressure, migration situation, trend of urbanization, industrialization & other social, cultural, ethnic & crimenogenic features of the concerned police station   
f) Other specific and peculiar features of the area necessitating extra allocation of resources

139.1 Bureau of Police Research & Development have worked out parameters, norms, scales and standards with regard to various functional and operational aids, equipment and resources to be made available to each category of police station. These facilities include equipment, tools and resources like fax, telephone, photocopier, furniture, wireless equipment, night vision devices, metal detectors, bomb disposal equipment, investigation and finger prints kits, camera, video camera, tape recorder, testing kits, breaths analyzer, search and packing kits, binoculars, body protectors, arms and ammunition, vehicles and other functional and operational equipment. While making resource allocation of various types to the police station the BPR&D parameters, norms and standards should work as a basic reference for this purpose.

te following reports and parameters evolved by the BPR&D are relevant in this contex!

Modernization & up gradation of police infrastructure- A five y ear projectio. Vehicle requirement of Police Units . Scale of weapons for Police Units Scale of communication facilities for Police Units Scale & authorization of general police equipment for various Police Units.

# Police Station Buildings

140.

The police stations, thus, have a very vital significant and important role in the functioning of various crime record Bureaux.

# The Specific Contexts

161. The success, efficiency and effectively of each Crime Records Bureau would depend on the authenticity, reliability and correctness of the data supplied to it from the feeder unit. The feeder units are responsible for providing authentic, reliable and correct information and data to the concern Bureaux and they should discharged their duty with at most diligence, care and responsibility.

161.1 The functioning of all the Crime Records Bureaux is dependent on the cooperation and coordination from each other. All efforts must be made to maintain healthy, useful and meaningful coordination among all these Bureaux because they form the bedrock of information system of the entire country.

161.2 Instructions, procedures and methods prescribed by the NCRB, SCRB and DCRB should be followed for collection and transmission of data and the forms, formats and returns prescribed in this regard should be used so as to make the system of crime records and their maintenance systematic, scientific, useful and uniform.

# Chapter 12

# Forensic Science Laboratory

# Introduction

162. Dispensing of justice is dependent primarily upon the evidence produced and presented before the court of law. During the course of evidence the Investigating Officer collects various kinds of evidences. These evidences are categorized as oral, documentary and scientific evidences. Various types of items, things and materials are available on a scene of crime, which are known as exhibits. An IO collects these exhibits from the scene of crime and other places and sends them for scientific analysis, evaluation and examination to the laboratories. These are called Forensic Science Laboratories. All States have one or more forensic science laboratories for providing scientific aid, assistance and expert opinion on various subjects for an effective, efficient and just administration of criminals' justice in their areas.

# Forensic Science : Its Implication

163. Forensic science is a dynamic field comprising mainly the application of various branches of science to the administration of justice. The criminal investigation in a way is a team effort, where the police and the forensic scientist, play the coordinated and mutually reinforcing role. Forensic science experts help the police officers in establishing the missing links between the crime and the suspects. Recent advancements in forensic sciences have virtually changed the very concept with the result; the role of forensic science has no longer remained confined to the criminal administration only. This extends to various areas including civil, regulatory, revenue and even to law and order, communal and terrorist events.

# Classification

164. FSLs can be classified in the following three categories:

A. State FSLs B. Central FSLs C. Mini & Local FSLs

# A. State FSLs

164.1 For providing essential, requisite and urgent scientific and forensic support to the police department, a State level Forensic Science Laboratory is available in most of the States in India. In addition to the State level FSL, some States have regional level FSLs also. The State level FSL is headed by a senior, experienced and competent scientist, who is designated as Director, (FsL). Various other scientists in the rank of Additional Directors, Deputy Directors and Assistant Directors assist the Director. In addition, other scientists designated as Senior Scientific Officers, Senior Scientific Assistants and Junior Scientific Assistants are also posted to the FSL. Lab Assistants and other technical staff along with requisite support and ministerial staff are also made available to the State FSL. The sanctioned staff, equipment and other resources at the State FSL should depend on the type of activities it performs and the overall workload, which it carries out.

# Divisions of State FSL

164.2 A State FSL has the following divisions:

1.  Documents Division   
2. Chemistry Division   
3. Biology Division   
4. Physics Division   
5. Ballistics Division   
6. Toxicology Division   
7. Serology Division   
8. Narcotics Division   
9. Arson & Explosives Division   
10. Forensic Psychology Division   
11. Photo Division   
12. Computer Forensics Division   
13. DNA Finger Printing Division   
14. Polygraph Division

# Role of FSL

164.3 The role of the forensic science laboratories can be classified under the following heads:

i. Producing the evidence in a legally admissible form ii. Scientific examination and analysis of clue materials iii. Evaluating the result of scientific analysis and interpreting them iv. Effective use of forensic findings in the prosecution v. Helping the IOs and police in the following manner:

Recognition of evidence material at the scene of crime Collection and preservation of the clue material so recognized Analysis, examination and testifying the forensic findings Interpretation of the forensic clues

164.4 The experts and the scientists at the FSL should perform their tasks with utmost sincerity, honesty and impartiality in as much as the common man has great faith and trust in them. The speedy and quick disposal of work at their end contributes significantly in the early and quick disposal of the cases in the courts of law. They should be always willing and ready to render all help and assistance to the IOs in the interest of the case in which their help and assistance has been requested.

# B. Central FSLs

165. There are three central forensic science laboratories - one at Kolkata, the other at Chandigarh and the third at Hyderabad. These Laboratories, apart from doing research and development work also function as referral centers for cases, which require extensive investigation and high expertise. Such cases are referred by the courts as well as by other forensic science laboratories. Chandigarh laboratory is being developed as a Centre of excellence for specializing research work in physical sciences.

165.1 Central Government maintains laboratories of Government Examiners of Questioned Documents (GesQD) at Shimla, Kolkata and Hyderabad. The laboratory of Shimla is conveniently accessible to Punjab Police. It is being developed as a Centre of excellence for research in application of computers in analysis of questioned documents.

165.2 States can also utilize the services of DNA unit of CFSL, Kolkata, and neutron activation analysis unit, which functions at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, and is the only institution of its kind in the country.

165.3 The central laboratories and GEsQD laboratories are managed by BPR&D. Forensic science division of BPR&D conducts a series of training and retraining courses in strategic technologies for practice in major fields of forensic science for scientists of state forensic science laboratories. The division coordinates all forensic science activities including research and development Programme in the country through central and state FSLs and three GesQD. This division, in addition, holds annual meetings of directors of state and central FSLs and biennial conference on forensic science. It also provides consultancy service to state governments for setting up new laboratories and reorganisation/upgradation of existing ones.

# C. Mini & Local FSLs

166. Mini forensic science laboratories with workable equipment and know-how can be set up at the district level for immediate and instant examination of exhibits and inspection of scene of crime for the assistance of the IOs. A scene of crime is generally a veritable mine of clues of profound evidentiary value. These clues have to be preserved and prevented from contamination till the arrival of forensic science teams from laboratory or a mobile unit. Arrival of these teams at the scenes of crimes takes time depending upon the distance involved between their location and the scenes of crimes. Police personnel of the nearby police station or outpost are generally the first official functionaries to reach a scene of crime.

166.1 The responsibility for preservation of the scene of crime and prevention of clues from contamination rests on these police personnel. In many cases, due to dearth of resources, it is not possible to deploy forensic science teams to all the scenes of crimes. The police personnel mentioned above have to identify, lift, pack, and forward the clues to forensic science laboratory for examination in cases not covered by the visits of forensic science teams. The experts of mini and local laboratories of the district headquarter can play a very significant and meaningful role in helping and assisting the IOs in the discharge of the above functions. These labs should have reasonable number of experts of the rank of Junior Scientific Assistant with adequate equipment to discharge their duties. The number of such experts and the equipment required may vary from district to district. These mini labs should function under the overall command and control of the district SP. Preferably a mobile scientific van should be made available to this team.

# Specific and Special Contexts

167. FSLs of various categories should be well equipped in terms of scientific aids, equipment, technical know-how and the latest technology in the respective areas of their work and functioning. Availability of reasonable resources in terms of man, material, scientific and technological contexts can alone make these FSLs competent and efficient for the performance of their various tasks. Constant modernization of FSLs should therefore be an area of priority.

167.1 An appropriate attitude of coordination and cooperation should be maintained by all the experts working at the various FSLs. Their services and assistance can be demanded at any time, and such demands being urgent in nature require that they should provide immediate, willing and instant help. Likewise the various FSLs should also maintain a healthy understanding and interaction among themselves and also with the various field formations of the police department and the PHQ.

# Chapter 13

# Fingerprints and Footprints Bureau

# Introduction

168. In all criminal proceeding, personal identification plays an important role. Fingerprints serve as the most valuable, infallible and accurate means of personal identification, and have since long become an indispensable tool in the investigation of crime and administration of justice. Investigation of a crime is primarily meant to identify the person or persons responsible for the crime and connecting them with the crime on the basis of clues available on the scene of crime or on the basis of other pieces of evidence. Fingerprints assist the IOs in this respect by providing a scientific clue to identify and connecting the criminals with the crimes.

# Concept

169. The two fundamental principles of finger print science are: the ridges formed even before birth does not change until destroyed by decomposition after death and that two fingerprints can be identical only if they are both produced by the same finger of the same person. These two principles are applicable to the entire palm surface of the hands as well as plantar surface of the feet.

# Fingerprints Bureau

170. In view of the importance, value and significance of Fps, each State police organization maintains Fingerprints Bureau, which now is an integral part of the Crime Records Bureaux System. Fingerprint Bureau is part and parcel of each SCRB at the State level, and that of each DCRB at the State level. The FPBx in the State, though happen to be part of the respective SCRBx and DCRBx, yet they maintain a reasonable level of autonomy and independence because they are headed by independent In charges at each level and have the privilege of receiving references directly from the concerned units and answering to their queries directly. The FPBx, at each level, should be suitably and adequately furnished in terms of man, material and resources in accordance with the workload on each one of them, which happens to vary as per the quantum of crime in the area of the various police units under their jurisdiction.

# Functions of FPBx

171. Each FPB performs the following functions:

a) Recording fingerprint slips of convicts;   
b) Searching of fingerprint slip, referred to it to ascertain antecedents;   
c) Comparisons and opinion on finger-impressions on documents in civil and criminal cases received from courts and other agencies;   
d) Comparison of latent prints and giving opinions, when required;   
e) Single digit recording and searches;   
f) Action on absconder's reports;   
g) Evidence in court;   
h) Elimination work;   
i) Research work; and   
j) Training

# Role of FPBx in Police Work

172. FPBx play important role in:

A. Furnishing criminal antecedents, providing the background of any individual detained under suspicious circumstances,   
B. Tracing of out-of-view criminals,   
C. Establishing the identity of unidentified dead bodies,   
D. Linking the criminal to the crime through chance prints,   
E. Identifying of accused persons from the records maintained,   
F. Assisting in apprehending proclaimed offenders, absconders and persons, who escaped from prisons,   
G. Giving opinion in documents bearing disputed fingerprints and   
H. Imparting training to Police Officers.   
1. Fingerprints have a role in prevention of crime and detection of crime. Especially in case of property offences, forgeries and fabrication of false documents.

# Duties of Police Officers in the Context of Fingerprints

173. It is essential for all police officers to acquire knowledge of the basic principles and techniques of search, location and identification of fingerprints. All police officers should thoroughly familiarize themselves with instructions and procedures set forth in this regard and comply with them in their work. Good work in tracing a criminal or clue to an offender obtained through skilful detection and use of chance prints must be rewarded. The police officers should make efforts at their personal level for improving their skills in this area and should willingly attend the Induction, In-service and on-job training courses organized from time to time by various training institutions. Specialist courses in the science of Fingerprints, Photography, Footprints and other scientific aids should become an integral part of the professional development of the policemen at various ranks because of the significance of the above areas in making them successful professionals.

# Sources of Fingerprints

174. Following are the main sources from where fingerprints can be collected:

A. Scene of crime   
B. Dead bodies   
C. Suspects   
D. Arrested persons   
E. Convicts   
F. Others

A. Scene of crime

174.1 Fingerprints found at the scene of crime are known as chance prints. These prints are found in three forms, i.e., visible prints, plastic prints and latent prints (Invisible Prints). Visible prints are those made by fingers smeared with some coloured substances like blood, ink, paints, etc. Such prints can be seen easily with the naked eye and require no development. They can be photographed for preservation and comparison. Plastic prints are those made on plastic or pliable materials such as soap, melted candles, wax, tar, adhesive gum, etc. These prints also need no development and can be photographed directly using oblique light. Latent prints are those formed by the medium of sweat and they are the most common type of chance prints available at the scene. As the name indicates, and since they are formed through the medium of sweat, they are indistinct and cannot be seen as easily as other types of prints. These have to be developed either by chemical methods or by use of physics in order to make them visible before are photographed.

174.2 The scene of crime should remain undisturbed and intact for searching chance prints from it. The search for chance prints should be conducted carefully and systematically. The search should start from the point of entry into the premises, such as windows, ventilators, chimneys, roof holes, skylights where chance prints are most commonly found. Thereafter the search should extend to all places at the scene where the culprits moved during the commission of crime, ending at the point of exit. All the articles suspected to have been disturbed or handled by the offenders during the commission of offence should be thoroughly examined.

174.3 Articles bearing chance prints should be preserved from damage by unwanted persons and climatic conditions. Great care is to be taken by the police officer reaching the scene first, to keep away -unconcerned persons and by collecting movable articles, left in the open, and placing them in a safe place. A cover should be put over immovable articles, protecting the chance prints from sun, rain and dust. While doing so, no damage should be caused to the prints already existing on the articles. The police officer should not leave his own prints on them.

174.4 Latent (Invisible) fingerprints found on various items at the scene of crime can be developed to render them visible by spraying powders, solutions and gases depending on the background and nature of print. In case the articles are to be sent to the FPB for expert's examination, they should be packed with care and security by the Investigating Officer, so that no damage is caused to the prints or articles during packing or transit either by careless handling or friction from packing material.

174.5 When chance prints are found in narrow nooks and corners, or the inner surfaces of jewel cases, jars and flower vases, where it is not possible to photograph them, the clues of evidence should be secured and preserved by the process of lifting. The method adopted in shifting FPs is to press the gummy surface of a transparent cellophane tape against the developed chance prints without forming air bubbles lift it and transfer them to a contrast lift cards. Lifting should be resorted to only for those prints where photography is not possible, as there is every risk of the prints getting partly or wholly damaged in the process. Lifting of chance prints also can be done on all surfaces after photography, making use of latest methods like iodine fuming, ninhydrin, glueing and applying multiple wave length light derived from Polilight, Poliray etc. or Laser beams.

# B. Dead bodies

175. Dead bodies are yet another source of obtaining finger prints. In every case of murder or other unnatural death of an unidentified person or recovery of an unidentified dead body the fingerprints of the dead body must be taken for comparison with the prints on record in the Finger Print Bureau or elsewhere. In taking fingerprints from a dead body, it is a wise precaution to wear gloves. The technique to be employed in taking the fingerprints of a dead body will greatly depend on the state of the body. If the body is fresh and its fingers flexible, fingerprints can be taken on a standard finger print form through the usual inking and rolling process. The fingers of the corpse should be carefully cleaned and all moisture removed. A piece of clean cloth soaked in turpentine oil may be used for the purpose. When rigor mortis has set in, the usual inking and rolling process will not succeed and ink has to be directly applied to the finger with a rubber roller and the print taken by holding the paper in the palm of the hand and pressing it against the finger. A curved metal or wooden spoon cut to fit the fingers and provided with a slot to hold the paper is best used for the purpose. If the fingers are clenched, they will have to be forcibly straightened. In extreme cases, a surgeon should cut the controlling tendons in order to straighten the fingers. When the skin of the fingers is shrunken or wrinkled due to submersion in water etc., the surface of the fingers can be rounded out and smoothened by injecting glycerin or melted paraffin or hot water or air into the tissues. In case of any difficulty in obtaining inked impressions from the fingers of dead bodies by above methods, the services of district Finger Print Unit staff may be obtained. When putrefaction has started, the skin of each fingertip should be carefully cut and placed in a labeled bottle or tube containing formaldehyde solution. A separate container should be used for the skin of each finger and properly labeled. Fingerprints of lepers should not be taken and the fingerprints of persons suffering from contagious or infectious diseases should not be taken until they get completely recover.

175.1 Points to be noted for forwarding the amputated fingers of unknown dead body for identification are following:

A. The skin (upper layer-Epidermis portion) of each finger should be carefully cut up to the end of the first phalange and placed in an unbreakable screw type bottle with wide mouth with a preservative (solution). A separate container should be used for the skin of each finger and properly labeled indicating the name/digit of each finger and hand.

B. All the bottles containing the skins of the fingers should be carefully packed in a carton and sent to the District Finger Print Unit through a special messenger for examination and obtaining of linked finger impressions.

# C. Suspects

176. The fingerprints of the persons, who have come under the shadow of suspicion due to any reason should be taken for verification or otherwise of the suspicion. Such prints are sent to the concern FPB for comparison and establishing the identity of the suspects. Such suspects can be known or unknown or may or may not be identifiable by the police. The fingerprints of the rowdy persons, anti-social elements and history-sheeters are taken by the police because they are under a shadow of suspicion and might or might have involved in some crime or the other. Such fingerprints are sent as record for being used in future or the verification of the suspects in question for his involvement in some crime.

# D. Arrested persons

177. The fingerprints of the arrested persons, except the local residents, who are arrested or convicted in trivial offences, are taken by police for connecting the arrested persons to the crime on the basis of fingerprints on the exhibits recovered from the scene of crime or to ascertain whether the arrested person has been involved in some crime in the past.

# E. Convicts

178. Fingerprints of the convicted persons are taken to maintain the record of convicts for being used in future or for ascertaining whether the concerned convict is involved in crime in some other police station.

# F. Miscellaneous Aspects & the Summary

# Method of Taking Fingerprints

180. Fingerprints should be taken with care and precaution by making use of the tools, process and methods prescribed for this purpose. This would include:

A. Appliances B. Preparation of appliances C. Inking the fingers

D. Taking impressions   
E. Slips to be folded for taking rolled prints   
F. Order of taking prints   
G. Entry of details on slips   
H. Precautions for preparing fingerprints slip

# A. Appliances

181. The appliances required for taking fingerprints comprise a glass slab, a rubber roller and printer's black ink (thumb impression ink). These must be kept scrupulously clean and free from dust, grit and hairs. The slab should be freshly cleaned before use each day, all particles of old ink being rubbed off. The roller, when not in use, should be kept wrapped up in a piece of clean oilpaper. Both slab and roller should periodically be cleaned with soap, benzene or kerosene. The pot of ink should be kept tightly closed when not in use. The table used should be of correct height to keep the subjects' forearm in a horizontal position.

# B. Preparation of Appliances

182. The slab must be perfectly smooth and should be wiped free of dust before use. A small quantity of ink should then be put on the slab and the roller used to bring it down to the finest possible film, so that the glass is dimly visible through the ink. Experience has shown that it is easier to start with a very small quantity of ink and to increase it as necessary. If excessive ink is applied to the slab, a sheet of paper laid on it and rolled over with the roller will generally reduce it sufficiently. If the ink is dry and thick, it will be found that with a little perseverance it can be worked up smooth on the slab.

# C. Inking the Fingers

183. The fingers of the subject should be rubbed clean and dry, as the slightest perspiration on the finger will cause blotches and blur the print. Only the inner portion of the upper phalanges of the fingers should be inked. To take a 'rolled' impression, the finger should be placed on the inked slab, the plane of the nail being at right angles to the slab, and turned over till the bulb surface, which originally faced to the left, now faces to the right. For a 'plain' impression, the ridge surface of the finger should be placed flat on the inked slab. The operator should always keep the subject towards his right and uniform pressure maintained throughout the rolling process keeping control over the subject's hand and fingers. The operator should not talk or otherwise distracted while taking fingerprints to avoid recording a print in wrong place.

# D. Taking Impressions

184. Prints must be taken on the authorized Finger Print Slip. In the slip, space has been provided for the 'rolled' prints of all the ten digits, as well as for the 'plain' prints of the four fingers of each hand. The headings of the slip are self-explanatory.

# E. Slips to be Folded for Taking Rolled Prints

185. For convenience in taking 'rolled' prints, the slip should be folded at the line indicated and the fold placed in line with edge of the table.

# F. Order of Taking Prints

186. The 'rolled' prints of the right hand should be taken first, each finger being inked and impressed before the next finger in rotation is inked. When the 'rolled' prints of all the fingers of the right hand have been taken, the 'plain' prints of the four fingers of that hand simultaneously should be taken in the space provided for them on the slip. The operator should then proceed to take the prints, 'rolled' and 'plain' of the left hand in a similar manner.

# G. Entry of Details on Slips

187. After the fingerprints of both hands have been taken, the slip should be turned over and print of the subject's left thumb should be taken in the space provided for the purpose. The subject's name, residence, and details of conviction should immediately be filled in on the reverse of the form and he (the subject) should then sign on the form or put his thumb impression, if unable to sign. The Finger Print Slips of one subject should be completely filled in, before that of another is commenced, to avoid the risk of the particulars of a subject being entered in the wrong slip.

# H. Precautions for Preparing Fingerprints Slip

188. The following precautions should be specially taken while preparing FP Slips:

i. Impressions must invariably be taken with the tip of the finger pointing to the top of the form, except in the case of the 'plain' print of the left thumb on the reverse of the slip.

i. The 'rolled' prints should show the complete contour of the bulbs of the fingers. One delta in the case of the 'loops' and two in the case of "whorls" should be visible.   
ii. The 'rolled' print of each finger must be taken in the space allotted for that finger and the impression should not project beyond that space. The impression on only the upper phalanx of the finger should appear.   
iv. All names, whether of persons or places, should be written legibly. All entries should be in English or in the language used in the State and should be as concise as possible. Convictions should be entered in chronological order. V. On the FP Slips of females, whether sent for search or record, the word 'Female' should be written boldly in red ink on the top right hand corner of the slip containing impressions.   
vi. In the case of convicts who remain unidentified, of the two words 'unidentified' and 're-convicted' appearing on the top left hand corner of the slip containing the entries of convictions, the word 're-convicted' should be scored out in red ink.   
vii. FP Slips for dispatch should be so folded that the creases of fold do not run through the prints.   
viii. If a finger is missing or is so deformed that it is impossible to obtain an impression that fact should be noted in ink in the space allotted for that finger by words 'missing' or 'deformed'. In the case of double fingers, the prints of both the fingers should, if possible, be taken; otherwise the print of the more prominent of the two should invariably be taken. Deformities, cuts, scars and disease marks interfering with the clarity of the impressions should be fully described and it should be stated if they are temporary or permanent. Fingerprints of persons suffering from open cuts or scars in any of the upper phalanges of the fingers should not be taken until the cuts or scars have healed.   
ix. If a person has more than five fingers on a hand, impressions of the thumb and

the four fingers next to it should be taken in the squares allotted to them on the slip. If the extra finger is outside the thumb, its impression should be taken in the space on the slip before the thumb, and if it is outside the little finger, in the space after the little finger.

x. The police officer must comply with the following instructions in fingerprint work:

Write the name of the individual on the FP slip before taking his fingerprint   
Furnish the address on a search reference as to whom the result of search has to be communicated.   
Furnish crime number on search reference at the time of arrest and also on conviction memo after conviction of an individual. Always use proper ink and pressure while taking fingerprints. Fingerprints obtained on FP slips to be sent to FPB should be clear and fully rolled. Fingerprint slips along with a conviction memo must be sent to District F.P. Unit and FPB for record after an individual is convicted. Attest the conviction particulars entered on the reverse of the FP slip to be sent along with conviction memo to FPB without fail. Remember always to use separate containers for preserving severed fingers of an unidentified dead body. Never allow any unauthorized person to disturb the scene of crime or articles there and damage physical evidence left on them before the arrival of FP expert. Always take care of the scene of crime articles, which are exposed bearing chance prints by providing shelter or cover to protect them from sun, rain, dust etc., to prevent damage to the clues, before they are examined by an FP Expert. Always make it a point to utilize the services of a Fingerprint Expert if any chance prints are suspected to exist on any article at the scene Of crime.

# Transmission, Submission, Forwarding & Sending FP Slips to Various Units

189. Fingerprints Slips are required to be sent to various units either for record or for verification. This work is done at the following levels as per the prescribed procedures:

A. FP Slips to be Sent by SHOs for Record to SCRB Through DCRB.

B. FP Slips to be Sent for Record to CFPB Through SCRB.   
C. FP Slips to be Sent by DCRB to SCRB and Central Bureaux.   
D. Procedure for Sending FP Slips by SCRB to Central Bureau.   
E. Search Slips to be Sent by Police Station and Investigation Units.

# A. FP Slips to be Sent by SHOs for Record to SCRB Through DCRB.

190. It is the responsibility of SHOs and in charge of investigating unit to take the fingerprints of persons who, on conviction, have to be finger printed. Four sets of fingerprints shall be taken on the arrest of an accused person and the name and other particulars filled in, immediately after the prints have been recorded. Resistance to, or refusal to allow, the taking of finger prints is an offence under Section 186 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 6 of the Identification of Prisoners Act. If a person, who is required to allows his finger prints to be taken, resists, or refuses to allow, the taking of the same, it shall be lawful, under Section 6(1) of the Identification of Prisoners Act, to use all means necessary to secure the taking thereof.

190.1 The Station House Officer or the concerned officer will, at the time of arrest, fill up the description of the arrested person, sign on the first page, and send one set for search direct to the State Bureau. If the person charged is convicted, all the particulars of the conviction should be filled in and, if the convict has previous convictions, all particulars of his previous and present convictions in the chronological order with their Finger Print Bureau serial numbers and regular criminal number shall be entered in the second and third sets of finger print slips and forwarded to the District Crime Records Bureau, together with the Court Disposal Form (Conviction Memorandum). The finger print slip should be folded in accordance with the directions on the form. Should the Superintendent of Police decide on the Court Disposal Form (Conviction Memorandum) that the finger prints of an accused person undergoing imprisonment in a jail are to be recorded, the Court Disposal Form (Conviction Memorandum) will be numbered and forwarded with the finger print slip to the District Crime Records Bureau of the district, in which the jail where the prisoner is imprisoned, is situated.

# B. FP Slips to be Sent for Record to CFPB Through SCRB.

191. Fingerprint slips of all persons convicted for offences prescribed should be sent to the State Bureau, along with a duplicate finger print slip in each case for record in the Central Finger Print Bureau. The finger print slips intended for record in the Central Finger Print Bureau should be sent through the State Bureau and not direct. However the finger print slips of suspects, intended for search to trace their antecedents, can be sent to CFPB directly by the SHO.

# C. FP Slips to be Sent by DCRB to SCRB and Central Bureaux.

192. One set of finger print slips of all persons convicted of any offence mentioned for the purpose shall be prepared by the District Crime Records Bureau for being sent to the Central Finger Print Bureau, in addition to the number of sets required for the State Bureau.

192.1 The District Crime Records Bureau, with the help of District Finger Print Unit staff, should scrutinize the slips for clarity of prints and the correctness of entries before sending these slips for record to the State and Central Buraux. While sending finger print slips for record, dispatch memoranda should be used, filling the relevant entries in all the foils of the Form.

192.2 All fingerprint slips of convicts for record at the Central Finger Print Bureau shall be sent in triplicate dispatch memoranda through State Bureau. When the State Bureau sends finger print slips for record to other Bureaux, it shall issue triplicate dispatch memorandum along with these fingerprints slips. In no case, should finger print slips of more than ten persons be sent under a single dispatch memorandum.

# D. Procedure for Sending FP Slips by SCRB to Central Bureau.

193. The State Bureau shall maintain a register to keep an account of the dispatch memoranda received from the District Crime Records Bureaux. The State Bureau, on receipt of finger print slips meant for record at the Central Bureau, shall once again examine the clarity of finger impressions, scrutinize the order of impressions and entries on the slips, and return to the District Crime Records Bureau those finger slips that are unfit for record or do not contain full particulars. The State Bureau, which is to issue dispatch memoranda for sending finger print slips to the Central Finger Print Bureau, shall also maintain a register for this purpose.

193.1 The State Bureau shall forward to the Central Bureau only such finger print slips that are fit for record and contain correct particulars.

The State Bureau shall keep an account of the finger print slips returned to the District Crime Records Bureau for rectification of defects. The State Bureau shall ensure that all finger print slips returned for rectification of defects are submitted to the Central Bureau under a fresh dispatch memorandum.

193.2 All intimations regarding absconders shall be sent by the State Bureau to the Central Bureau (and, if required to the FPBx of other States) under a dispatch memorandum along with a finger print slip, if available, with particulars of the case in which they are wanted, and the office to which the intimation of arrest is to be given (in BLOCK LETTERS). In the case of intimation regarding absconders, whose finger print slips are not available, the State Bureau shall send a photocopy of the F.P. record slip of the State under a dispatch memorandum.

193.3 The State Bureau shall ensure that finger print slips of persons convicted for the first time and finger print slips of persons re-convicted are sent under separate dispatch memoranda. In sending fingerprint slips of persons traced by the Central Bureau, the formula supplied by the Central Bureau on the search slip shall be noted on the finger print record slip of the State Bureau. The State Bureau, on receipt of duplicate dispatch memoranda, with classification formula, from the Central Bureau, shall file one copy at the State Bureau and send the other to the District Crime Records Bureau. The State Bureau shall ensure that intimation regarding absconders is dispatched to the Central Bureau within a week from the date of its receipt of the information. The State Bureau shall ensure that all finger print slips meant for record at the Central Bureau are dispatched within a week from the date of its receipt of the slips.

193.4 The State Bureau shall ensure that one extra copy of each finger print slip of interState/international criminals, illicit fraud explosives traders and smugglers, 'auto' thieves, hotel thieves, poisoners, forgers of currency, cheats and coiners those who deal in forged or false travel documents and certificates is taken for single digit record at the Central Bureau and sent to the Central Bureau with a short note on the modus operandi.

193.5 The State Bureau shall bring to the notice of the Central Bureau all new features regarding the science of identification from fingerprints observed by them and any forgery of fingerprints, which they may come across. The State Bureau may refer to the Central Bureau for scrutiny any case of difference of opinion arising between two State Bureaux. The State Bureau may seek the help of the Central Bureau in solving all problems relating to the science of identification from papillary ridges. All correspondence with the Central Bureau shall be addressed to the Director, Central Finger Print Bureau/NCRB, RK Puram, East Block-VII, New Delhi- 110066.

# E. Search Slips to be Sent by Police Station and Investigation Units.

194. The fingerprints of all unidentified persons who are arrested as suspects or are under trial on a criminal charge will be taken by the SHO/IO and submitted to the State Bureau for search with a Search Slip in the prescribed form. In such cases, the search slip should contain full details of the circumstances under which the suspect has come into the hands of the police and also information regarding convictions, with the Bureau serial numbers, if known. The State Bureau will return the counterfoil of the search slip, duly filled in, for file with the trifoil in the Police Station.

194.1 For this purpose, every person in custody whose residence and antecedents are not known or have not been fully ascertained during police investigation, or of persons, who, though known, have been out of view for some time, will be considered to be 'Unidentified'. The fingerprints of all unidentified persons who are arrested as suspects or are under trial on a criminal charge will be forwarded to the District Finger Print Unit of the district for comparison with the ten-digit Finger Record maintained by them as also the photo chance prints.

194.2 The Finger Print slips of all unidentified persons reasonably suspected to be residents of or to have extended their criminal operations to another State or States shall be sent for search direct to the Bureau/Bureaux of the State or States of which they are residents or to which their operations are believed to have extended. The fingerprints of persons convicted in one State who are believed to have had their origin in another State, though not actually identified as residents thereof shall be taken in triplicate and sent to the Bureau of this State, one copy for record in the State Bureau, one copy for the Finger Print of the District Unit for record and comparison with the photo chance prints and the third for transmission to the

Bureau of the State of origin of the convict. The Finger Prints of an adolescent sent to special institutions like Juvenile Homes should be sent for record to the Bureau of the State of which he is a resident and a copy kept in the Bureau of the State in which he is convicted.

# 195. Fingerprint Slips: Some Important Aspects

A. Type of Fingerprint Slips   
B. Who is Authorised to fill the Slips   
C. No. of Copies of Slips for Record of Conviction   
D. How to Prove Conviction   
E. Maintenance & Scrutiny of FPS by State Bureaux

# A. Type of Fingerprint Slips

196. Fingerprints slips are of two kinds (1) Fingerprint record slip, and (2) Fingerprint search slip. The fingerprint record slip is prepared immediately after a person is convicted or reconvicted and sent for record to the Bureau along with the conviction memorandum. The fingerprint search slip is the FP slip of a suspect taken by the SHO and sent for search to the Bureau in order to know his antecedents.

# B. Who is Authorised to fill the Slips

197. Finger impressions will be taken only by proficient under the direction of an officer of the rank of Sub-Inspector or above as provided in the Identification of Prisoners' Act (Act XXXIII of 1920). The Sub-Inspector or the Inspector directing the proficient to take finger impressions should sign the fingerprint slip. In each Police Station including Railway Police Station there should at least be two Proficients. The proficient should be at least of the rank of either a Head Constable or a senior Police Constable.

197.1 The fingerprints of all unidentified persons who are arrested as suspects or are under trial on a criminal charge will be taken by the Station House Officer and submitted to the State Bureau with a search slip (counterfoil and trifoil) for search, after entering the details in the Fingerprint Register of Unidentified Persons. The search slip should contain full details of the circumstances under which the suspect has come into the hands of the police and also information regarding convictions with Bureau serial number, if known. The Bureau will return the trifoil of the search slip duly filled in to the Station House Officer. For this purpose, every person in custody whose residence and antecedents are not known or have not been fully ascertained during the police investigation, or of persons, who though known, have been out of view for some time, will be considered to be 'unidentified'.

# C. No. of Copies of Slips for Record of Conviction

198. Of ordinary convicts convicted in their home State, two copies will be taken, one copy for record in the Bureau of the State and one for the district fingerprints unit of the concerned districts. This will include convicts who are wanderers, unidentified or whose operations are known to extend beyond the limits of their home State; or though residents of the State of conviction are really outsiders and are thus likely to have relations with criminals of other States; or Who have been notified under the Habitual Offenders Act and are known or believed to be connected with organized gangs in other States; or Who have been convicted of theft of fire-arms and ammunition or under Arms, Opium, NDPS or Excise Acts in circumstances which render it likely that they are illicit inter-state dealers in arms and ammunition, opium, cocaine or other drugs; or psychotropic substances, or members of an organized crime syndicate or any terrorist group.

198.1 For persons have been convicted under Section 328 of the Indian Penal Code, if the offence was of a professional type or under Sections 231 to 253 of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 489-A to 489-D and who are believed to be operating in another State, as many copies will be taken as are required for record in (i) the State Bureau (ii) District Finger Print Unit (ii) the Bureau of the State of which the convict is alleged to be residents or to which his operations are known to have extended and (iv) the Central Finger Print Bureau and (v) NCRB, New Delhi

198.2 If a foreigner is convicted of an offence of the type in which finger-prints would ordinarily be taken for record under the rules, the fingerprints and photographs should be taken in duplicate and sent by the Superintendent of the district in which the case was registered, one for record in the State Bureau and the other for transmission to the Central Fingerprint Bureau.

# D. How to Prove Conviction

199. If on the return of the search slip from the Bureau, it is found that previous convictions have been traced against the accused, steps should be taken to prove such previous convictions, when necessary, under Section 298 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Act No. 2 of 1974) which requires that a certified copy of the previous conviction should be filed; and the identity of the accused should be proved. In the case of a person who has been previously convicted more than once, it will generally be suffice to prove last conviction only, provided that the former convictions were proved in that case and are mentioned in the judgment. The identity of the accused should ordinarily be proved by the evidence of a police officer who is personally aware of the previous convictions or by a prison officer who can recognize the accused as the prisoner who underwent the previous sentence. However, if such witnesses to identity cannot be obtained, identity may be proved under Section 45 and 73 of the Indian Evidence Act, by means of expert evidence, for which purpose the record slip must be obtained from the Bureau by which the accused was traced and services of an "Expert" requisitioned from the State Finger Print Bureau.

# E. Maintenance & Scrutiny of FPS by State Bureaux

200. All classifications and arrangements of slips will be done in the State Bureau in accordance with the instructions contained in the book 'classification and uses of Finger Prints' by Sir E.R. Henry. Some important points in this regard are following:

i. All slips received for search will be returned by the State Bureau, after due search, to the Station House Officers concerned within 24 hours of receipt, as far as possible.   
ii. Every slip received for record shall be carefully scrutinized before being classified, checked and recorded. If found deficient in any respect, it will be returned with an objection memorandum for submission of amended or fresh slip. If the prints in a slip are found to be smudged or otherwise unfit for comparison, a fresh slip has to be taken by the Finger Print Head Constable in the Jail before it was tested by the Tester (Expert).   
iii. The slips of a person reported to have died in jail will be removed from the record and destroyed at once. In case of the reported death of a person other than in jail, the date of death will be marked in red ink across the slip, which will remain in the record for another two years when it will be removed and destroyed.   
iv. All slips should be examined annually and, in the absence of any special reasons to the contrary, these should be withdrawn from the record and also from the data entered in the computers:

A. In the case of a person who is a professional poisoner, note forger, coiner, arms smuggler, organized crime syndicate or gang members or leader or a habitual offender notified under Habitual Offenders Act, on his attaining the age of 80 years or on his death whichever is earlier.

B. In the case of any other person:

If he has not more than two convictions in his native district (not having been convicted outside his native district) and has not, subsequent to his conviction or last conviction, as the case may be, been suspected of crime or convicted, on the expiry of ten years from the date of his release or last release from jail, as the case may be; or If he has been convicted outside his native district or has more than two convictions in his native district and has not more than two convictions in his case may be, been suspected of crime or convicted, on the expiry of 15 years from the date of his release or last release from jail, as the case may be; or   
On his attaining the age of 80 years; or   
On his death, whichever is the earlier.   
v. To prevent the possibility of wrong destruction of a finger print slip in the Bureau, slips withdrawn from record will be sent to the Superintendent of Police concerned for information and destruction. The SP will pass them on to the Sub-divisional Officer concerned for necessary action. If the Sub-divisional Officer has any objection to the destruction of any particular slip, he should return it to the Bureau through the Superintendent of Police explaining fully why he wants it to be retained.   
vi. All copies of slips taken for record shall be forwarded by District Crime Records Bureaux to the State Bureau, which in turn will transmit the slips intended for other State Bureaux, noting on all copies the names of the Bureaux in which the finger prints are on record. The State Bureau will intimate the destruction of finger print slips, which are on record in other Bureaux, to those Bureaux.

# Record to be Maintained at the SFB

201. In the State Fingerprint Bureau two kinds of records are maintained. One is ten digit FP records for the purpose of establishing both identity and past criminal history of a suspected individual, to locate wanted criminals who escape from police, and to know the identity of unidentified dead bodies. In the ten digit type of collections FP slips of all individuals convicted for the offences specified are maintained according to the Henry system of classification. The second variety is the Single Digit FP records for the purpose of establishing the identity of offenders in crimes like house breaking, dacoity robbery and other crimes through fingerprints traced at the scene of crime. In Single Digit collections, fingerprints of all ex-convicts whose criminal activity relate to offences like dacoity, robbery, house breaking, and theft and other professional criminal are recorded according to Battely system of classification.

# Single-Digit Finger Print System

202. The object of single digit fingerprint collections is to provide a means for the rapid identification of fingerprints left at the scene of crime in cases where the culprits are not known. In this system all the ten fingers are classified and recorded digit-wise thus providing 10 sub-collections each containing the prints of a particular digit only. This arrangement enables identification from the fingerprint of a single finger found at the scene.

# Functions of DFP Unit

203. The DFP unit staff is required to perform the following functions:

1. To visit the scene of crime along with investigating officer if possible or separately for detection and development of chance prints whenever requisitioned.   
2. To visit the Police Stations and investigating teams within the District for collection of fingerprint slips of all ex-convicts concerned in property and other grave offences for building of single digit records for the efficient functioning of the DFP unit.   
3. To compare chance prints and search slips received from Police Stations and investigating teams with DFP record and communicate results thereof to sender.   
4. To scrutinize all fingerprint records slips of the convicts received by DCRB from SHOs and Investigation Units/DPS for transmission to the Main Bureau and advise whether they are correctly taken and fit for record; or to return them with suggestions, if they are not suitable.   
5. To visit the District/Central jails once a month to test the FP slips of those convicts received by DCRB who are undergoing imprisonment, and to prepare fresh slips for record if the slips are not properly taken on the earlier occasion or worn out.   
6. To testify in the courts in cases where chance prints are identified with the FP records of the District Finger Print section.   
7. To forward the chance prints to neighboring districts and Main Bureau for comparison when they are not identified.   
8. The SHO and IOs may utilize the services of the Experts from the SD FP Units to visit scenes of crime for development of chance prints and obtain their guidance on various aspects of fingerprint work.

203.1 The DFP units shall function under the technical control of the Director, FPB and over all control of State Crime Records Bureau. The DFP sections will, however, work under the immediate administrative supervision and control of the Superintendent of Police/Commissioner of Police/DCP Crimes concerned. The Finger Print Inspectors in charge of the units shall he responsible for the day-to-day functioning of their units.

# Procedure for Submission of FP slips for Record in the SDFP Units

204. Immediately after the conviction of criminal in concerned in crimes, the Station House Officer, (Investigating Officer) who is in charge of the team should take the finger impressions of the ten fingers of the convict on the prescribed form in duplicate and send it to the District Finger Print Unit of the district along with two sets of palm and foot prints of the convict, taken on plain white paper of reasonably thick quality.

204.1 The finger impression forms and foot and palm impression forms of the convict should contain the name, parentage, place of residence, address etc, of the convict and invariably with the signature of the Station House Officer. Care should be taken to see that the prints are very distinct and show the whole contour of the bulb of the fingers. The fingerprints, palm and foot impressions, which are meant for record in the DFP unit, should invariably be sent to the Inspector, SDFP unit through a name cover and marked as "Meant for SD Collection". Care should also be taken to see that the prints are not damaged in folding the paper containing the prints.

204.2 The success of the District Finger Print units depends on the quality of record that it builds up. Criminals belonging not only to towns but also those residing or operating in the entire District should be brought on to the record in the District Finger Print Unit including inter-district and inter-city criminals.

204.3 Every Police Station, (CCS, DPS, District investigation squads) in the district should submit to the district Finger Print Unit, a list of all history-sheeted criminals along with their fingerprint slips.

204.4 The Single Digit serial numbers assigned to the classified prints of the criminals by the single digit unit should be recorded against corresponding entries in Station Crime Record.

204.5 The SHOs and IOs must ensure the preservation of the scenes of crime and safe custody of suspected articles, in as-is-where-is condition. The scene of crime (SOC) articles should not be disturbed, touched or tampered with by any body until the development of chance prints by the DFP unit staff or the expert attached to the team is complete.

204.6 SHOs and all IOs in the districts should visit the district Finger Print Unit regularly during their visits to DCRB (at least once in a quarter) to review the stage of all such cases in which the services of the SDFP unit staff were requisitioned, whether all the FP slips of the persons sent by the SHO were received in the DFP unit, whether the photo chance prints were compared with the FP slips and if so, the results of comparisons, thereof and to know it any new orders or instructions received from the Director, SCRB and/or DCRB for compliance for greater co-ordination between the DFP unit and SHOs to update their knowledge of the latest changes, if any, made and to do any other reconciliation.

204.7 Station House Officers should requisition the services of the DFP Unit staff and facilitate their visit to crime scenes in all cases where finger print clues are likely to be available. The Station House Officers should promptly furnish to the DFP Unit full details of the case in which chance prints were developed, whenever they are finally detected. SHOs should send the finger print slips of all persons arrested in specific cases or under preventive sections, on day-to-day basis, to district Finger Print Unit for comparison with the collection of unsolved scene of crime chance prints. The Station House Officers of Railway Police Stations will comply with the above instructions treating the district Finger Print Unit having jurisdiction over the locality in which the offences occurred, as their own district Finger Print Unit concerned.

204.8 Each impression of ten-digit fingerprint slip is classified in 4 digit numeric characters. All the ten patterns of the fingers of both hands in their conventional order from right thumb to left little finger are classified in a 4 digit code each and then arriving at a 40 digit code for the FP impressions of the slip. This 4-digit code consists of 2-digit code for the type of fingerprint followed by 2-digit count-code of the pattern. This information of 40-digit code is stored in the computer database. Information like Regular Criminal Number, Provisional No., Henry classification etc. of the slip is also considered for the storage in the computer.

204.9 Twelve-digit number, which is given to the arrested person by the Investigating officer, the first five digits represents the code of the District and the Police Station where the FIR for the crime is registered. The next two digits represent the year of the FIR followed by FIR Number in four digits. The last digit, which is an alphabetic character, identifies the arrested person under the FIR from other arrested persons, if any, under the same FIR.

# Records & Registers

205. The following Records and Registers are kept in the Bureaux dealing with fingerprint work.

1) Register of fingerprint slips received for search.   
2) Register of identification made by the Fingerprint Bureau.   
3) Register of fingerprints slips received for record in the Fingerprint Bureau.   
4) Fingerprint Testing Register.   
5) Fingerprint Objection Memorandum Register.   
6) Requisition Register.   
7) Single Digit Finger Print card system.   
8) Palm Print Register.   
9) Foot print Register.   
10) Certificate of latent finger print examination Register   
11) Superior officers visiting book.   
12) Nominal Index Register.

# Computerization of Fingerprints

206. Use of Computer Technology in storing and retrieval of data will ensure availability of required information to the IOs in the field with speed and accuracy. The voluminous increase in fingerprint records has become laborious and time consuming. It is also difficult to identify chance prints developed at the scene of crime in the manual system. Several days are required before a search slip can be identified and the result communicated to the field officers. The record slips, which are subjected, to frequent handling, are liable to wear and tear and damaged soon. Diligence and continuous concentration and very careful maintenance is required to prevent mismatch and wrong identification.

206.1 Updating of records is a serious problem, as classification formula or serial number furnished by the police is not always correct. Every incoming FP slip has to be searched with reference to the main records to avoid duplication. FP slips bearing smudged prints, missing prints, and gradational type prints consume a great deal of time in the main bureau collections. To overcome handicaps in manual searching, computerization of fingerprint records and introduction of computerized search is necessary.

206.2 The computerization system assigns a serial number (Regualr Criminal Number, RCN) to each convicted person instead of to the slip based on first crime number. This number consists of 12 digits, the first five indicating the police station in which the criminal was first convicted, the next two the year of conviction and last five digits for the serial number. This RCN once given to a convict will remain constant throughout his criminal career, irrespective of the number of convictions he may accumulate.

206.3 Fingerprint slip of a suspected person is sent to the FPB to trace previous convictions; a provisional criminal number consisting of 11 digits and an alphabet is given by the concerned police station. The first three digits indicate the district, the next two indicate the police station where the individual is arrested, the next two the year of arrest and the next four digits are the crime number in which the person is arrested. The provisional criminal number of the suspected person has to be noted on the conviction memo and FP slip and then it is sent for record.

206.4 To derive maximum advantage from the system the SHOs should ensure that every FP slip sent to FPB for search or record must contain clear and fully rolled fingerprints. The services of fingerprint staff, SDFB or FP trained officer attached to each Investigating Unit should be taken.

206.5 With increase in the volume of finger print records, due to increasing crime rate and criminals, the pressure of expectations of IO's is to provide instant answers to their urgent queries. All these factors necessitated the application of computer technology in the application of fingerprint science.

206.6 For recording, classifying, coding, searching, and retrieving the ever-increasing fingerprint records, Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems have been developed by the British Home Office, FBI, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the West German Bunder Kriminalaty during the past decade. AFIS is an effective response to the problems of fingerprint search and comparison. Fingerprint matching problems are of two types. Ten print identification involves matching the subject's entire set of rolled impressions against a file of a known ten print impressions. Identification through latent fingerprints involves matching fragments of fingerprint impressions developed at a crime scene against a file of rolled impressions. AFIS can provide speed and accuracy in ten print searches and is the only answer to the problem encountered in search through available latent prints.

206.7 AFIS also improves the effectiveness of latent searches. Where there is no text of possible suspects, latent searches become nearly impossible to conduct by manual methods. Even after spending several man-hours the fingerprint expert cannot ensure the inclusion of the actual offender within a subset of known files small enough to be manually searched. Consequently, much latent evidence remains unused. It is never compared against a known file and does not lead to the identification of a criminal. To conduct these "cold" searches, where a single AFIS matching processor can execute hundreds of comparisons each second, it is possible to search even the largest of files.

206.8 All the computerised systems incorporate automatic scanning devices that can read and code fingerprint characteristics directly from standard fingerprint cards. One of the latest versions of such a system developed in USA, known as the Remote Point Booking System electronically scans fingerprints at a remote site of ink, latent or live sources, enhances them and then transmits them to a central site, for lightning-speed computerized matching. Operating across 58 remote sites the California remote access network (RAN) is the largest in the world. Such computerization networks will save each police officer hundreds of investigative hours, by identifying criminals or suspects through latent fingerprints without having to first develop a list of suspects. Latent prints, or even a partial print, or a chance print "lifted" from the scene of a crime can help identify a suspect the very same day. The system can also quickly provide positive identification of wanted suspects who happen to be in custody before they return to crime thereby eliminating the possibility of further criminal activity. This swift response to fingerprint queries will substantially increase the rate of apprehension of criminals in the coming years. AFIS dramatically accelerates the law enforcement process, comparing one latent print with millions on file in minutes, compared to searches of sub-files, which take very long time, and quite often without success.

206.9 The automatic fingerprint reader system, known as FINDER (Fingerprint Reader) used by FBI of USA, records FP data in an average processing time of 1/2 second per FP. Two types of digital information are generated, data on the minute (ridge endings and bifurcations) and ridge direction (average direction of ridge flow at regular selected intervals across a fingerprint), and a basic description of the general pattern of the FP.

# Other Important Points with Regard to Fingerprint System

207. Some important aspects with regard to fingerprinting system are following, which should be kept in mind by all the police officers dealing with issues of fingerprints.

A. Responsibility of Tester   
B. Transfer of Convicts to Other jail   
C. Disposal of Fingerprints Slips & Court Disposal Forms   
D. Escape to be Reported to the Bureau   
E. Report of Deaths

# A. Responsibility of Tester

208. The Tester/Expert, while proceeding to a jail to test the slips, will take with him the files containing the Court Disposal Forms (Conviction Memoranda) and fingerprint slips, besides a letter from the concerned Superintendent of Police addressed to the jail authorities. In conducting the test, the Tester/Expert will prepare for each prisoner a slip in Form and will satisfy himself that the prints have been properly taken on the original finger print slips and that they are those of the convict named in the slip, that all the particulars recorded in he slip are correct, that all convictions are properly and correctly entered and that the required number of copies have been taken. Any mistakes should be brought to the notice of the Superintendent of Police. Fingerprint slips on which the impressions are blurred or indistinct should be rejected and should be replaced by fresh slips prepared by the Tester/Expert. Where the finger print slips prepared by the Station House Officer are sufficiently clear, those slips should be sent to the State Bureau for record. After having tested the slips, the

Tester/Expert will note the word "Tested" with his initials and date (i) against the prisoner's name in the jail admission registers, (ii) in the District Crime Records Bureau Finger Print Register, (ii) on the back of the conviction slips, and (iv) on the history tickets. The Tester/Expert is responsible for the correctness of the convictions and all other details entered by him or the Station House Officer on the reverse of the slip. He will sign each slip that he has tested and his signature will be held to show that he has verified the sentence, previous convictions and personal details of the convict from the judicial and jail records.

# B. Transfer of Convicts to Other Jail

209. If a convict is transferred from a jail in one district to a jail located in another district before the arrival of the Tester/Expert, the Superintendent of Police of the district from which the prisoner has been transferred will forward the finger print slip and Court Disposal Form (Conviction Memorandum) to the Superintendent of Police of the district to which the prisoner has been transferred where it will be placed with the other slips of the district awaiting test. In case of a district, which does not have a district/central jail, the finger print slips and the Conviction Memoranda will be sent to the Superintendent of Police of the district where the jail in which the convict is imprisoned is located. Such slips with conviction memoranda will, after test, be returned to the Superintendent of Police of the district of conviction for transmission to the State Bureau.

# C. Disposal of Fingerprints Slips & Court Disposal Forms

210. Fingerprint Slips and Court Disposal Forms (conviction memoranda), after they have been tested will be made over by the Tester/Expert to the Superintendent of Police, who will send the slips with their relative Court Disposal Forms (conviction memoranda) to the State Bureau, provided that the time of appeal is over or the appeal (if any) has been decided. Every finger print slip sent for record to the State Bureau shall be accompanied by its relative Court Disposal Form (conviction memoranda). The State Bureau will return the Court Disposal Form (conviction memorandum) duly signed by the Director, Finger Print Bureau, with the Finger Print Bureau serial number and Regular Criminal Number noted in the space provided for the purpose. On receipt of the Court Disposal Form (conviction memorandum) from the State Bureau, the Superintendent of Police will send it to the Station House Officer, who will enter the Bureau serial number and Regular Criminal Number in the concerned Station records and keep the conviction memo in connected file. In subsequent references to the State Bureau, this serial number shall invariably be quoted.

# D. Escape to be Reported to the Bureau

211. When a prisoner escapes from police or jail custody and his finger prints have been taken previous to his escape, the finger print slip, whether it would otherwise be forwarded to the State Bureau or not under the rules, should be forwarded to the State Bureau at once with particulars of the circumstances of escape, so that it may be placed on record. When the slip has already been forwarded, it will be necessary to inform the State Bureau of escape, in order that the slip may be suitable marked. If any person whose finger print slip has been sent for record is subsequently declared a proclaimed offender, or escapes from jail or police custody, or absconds after committing some offence, the Station House Officer will immediately send information to the Superintendent of Police for transmission to the State FP Bureau. The same procedure will be followed when a criminal for whom a History Sheet is maintained in a station goes out of view.

211.1 On receipt of the report referred to a red slip will be attached to the slip so that immediate information may be given to the police by whom the absconder is wanted, in the event of the absconder's fingerprints being subsequently traced. In such cases, a copy of the finger print slip, if available, or the Bureau receiving the report to the other Bureaux in which the absconder's fingerprints are on record will send the absconder's classification number.

# E. Report of Deaths

212. If a convict whose fingerprints have been taken dies in the jail, the Superintendent of Police of the district in which the deceased was convicted, will forward a death report to the State FP Bureau. Should such convict die in jail after transfer, the Superintendent of Police of the district in which the jail is situated, will forward the death report to the SP of the district in which the deceased was convicted, who will forward the same to the State FP Bureau.

# Footprints and Track Marks

213. Footprints, and the route of footprints, known as Track Marks are often available on the scene of crime because a large number of people still walk barefoot in the countryside and inside their homes. The criminal perhaps finds it convenient to operate barefoot as it gives him a better hold to climb or slide, walk or run and also it does not make any sound to draw attention of the people during his criminal operations. Footprints and Track Marks provide good clue and a lead to the IOs for detecting crimes, and since they have evidentiary value also, therefore, they should be carefully lifted from the scene of crime. The subject matter of Footprints and Track Marks has following important dimension in the light of their investigational importance.

D. Collection   
E. Guidelines

A. Uniqueness

214. The human foot is unique in its structure and is therefore readily distinguishable from the foot of other animals. There are 28 bones in the human foot of which seven are tarsal bones; five are metatarsals, fourteen phalanges and two small bean size seasamoid bones. The two sesamoid bones are located below the head of the first metatarsal bone. The heal bone (calcaneum) and other tarsal bones bear most of the body weight while the metarsal bones and the phalanges articulate with the tarsal bones in the process of locomotion. The bones and other soft tissues like ligaments, muscles, padding material and skin on an applied pressure of the body produce a footprint that is proportional to the build and other characteristics of the foot.

# B. Shapes & Classification

215. The shapes of foot impressions differ from individual to individual. Broadly the shapes can be categorized into: (ii) Normal type foot, (ii) Club shaped foot, (ii) Bow type foot, (iv) Flat foot, (v) Broken bridge type foot and (vi) Accidental foot or Abnormal foot. Depending on the surface on which the prints are made, footprints can be classified into (i) Surface footprints and (ii) Sunken footprints. Surface prints are formed on hard surfaces like cement/stone floorings, tables, chairs, walls, etc. They are formed when the surface of the foot is coated with dust, dirt, oil, ink, blood, etc. Surface prints do not undergo any distortion and they register the distinguishing characteristics of the foot better than sunken prints. Surface prints have two dimensions, viz., length and breadth. Sunken prints are those that are found on pliable surface like soft clay, mud, loose soil, etc. Slightly sunken prints are usually formed on a small quantity of accumulated mud or soil on hard surfaces, e.g. a verandah. Moderately sunken prints are formed on slightly loose soils and deeply sunken prints are formed on mud, wet loose soils, clay, etc. The less sunken footprints offer a more definite clue for comparison than moderately sunken or deeply sunken footprints. The sunken footprints have an extra dimension in addition to surface print, i.e., the depth (or height).

# C. Location

216. Footprints can be located at the scene of crime, along the route and the assembly point where the criminals initially meet for their criminal operations. All these places should be properly searched for locating footprints for knowing the entry, exit, route and the number of criminals. The focal points of the scene of crime should be properly searched with reference to the nature of crime in each case. The search may be extended to the entire crime scene from the focal point. The route taken by the criminal both at the time of entry and exit should be thoroughly searched for his footprints.

# D. Collection

217. The methods commonly used for collecting footprints are:

(i) By preserving the original impression intact: If the footprint is found on a portable object such as a mat, slab, plank, card board, etc. It is convenient to carry the object bearing the print to the laboratory for photography and further analysis. It is advisable to take the photograph of the print even in such cases before removing them, as there is always the risk of the original impression being damaged in packing or transit.

(ii) Photography: All footprints, whether sunken or surface or any other track marks should first be photographed by keeping the lens of the camera parallel to the surface on which the marks or impression is found. The aperture of the diaphragm should be adjusted to get a proper depth of field. At least three photographs are to be taken, one direct view from the top and the other two from either side at an angle of 45 degree.

(iii) Tracing: Tracing is a rough method to record surface prints. A glass (or preferably a celluloid sheet) is held over the print as close as possible. Care should be taken to ensure that it does not come in contact with the print. Then a sketch pen draws the contours along the print line. Details such as the characters of the toes, ball of the foot, instep and heel together with crease; cracks, warts, etc. should carefully be traced on the sheet. After the tracing is complete the sheet is removed and all the particulars of the case should be written on the glass together with the signature of the investigating officer and the witnesses. On the basis of such prints on glass any number of tracings can be obtained on tracing paper. The glass sheet and a tracing paper should be packed in between two cardboards for transport to the court. The value of a traced print depends upon the personal observation skills of the person who is tracing the print and therefore is highly subjective and not very reliable. Other methods of recording like lifting and casting are preferred to tracing.

(iv) Lifting: When the print is formed on a surface that is of a similar colour to the print, for instances, a blood stained print formed on a red surface, dusty (white) print formed on a white surface, dark (black) print formed on a black surface, it becomes difficult to photograph the print because of the similar colour of the background. In such conditions the print could be collected using an appropriate photographic paper, like black photo bromide paper for a dusty or light coloured print and white photo bromide paper for a blood stained or black print.

(v) Footprints can also be lifted using photographic film or transparent adhesive tape. The fixed photographic film is moistened in water for few minutes until the emulsion side becomes tacky and then placed over the print with the sensitive side in contact with the print. A uniform pressure is applied over the film for few seconds and it is then lifted carefully. The print is transferred on to the film, which can then be used as a negative to make copies from.

(vi) Casting: Casts are prepared from foot impressions (sunken foot prints), tyre impressions or other impressions left behind by the criminal. A variety of materials are used to prepare the cast, however, plaster of paris is the most commonly used material.

# E. Guidelines

218. Following are the guidelines for obtaining good quality footprints.

(i) Carefully remove extraneous matter (grass, twigs, stone, etc.) from the impression without disturbing it.

(ii) Place a metallic or a wooden frame around the impression to prevent wastage of plaster of paris. Do not apply pressure on the frame, as it will damage the print.   
(ii) Spray shellac solution (about $2 5 0 ~ \mathrm { g m }$ of shellac dissolved in one litre of alcohol or a thinner solution) from a distance over the impression. Spray enough solution to get a thin film of shellac over the impression and allow the shellac to dry for 10-15 minutes.   
(iv) A thin layer of talcum powder is sprinkled on the layer of shellac to separate the shellac from the cast. Mineral oil or sewing machine oil is also employed for this purpose.   
(v) Take a container with 3 mugs of water and slowly pour 3 mugs of plaster of paris into water. Gently mix till it reaches a thick creamy consistency. The water and plaster of paris are taken in a 1:1 ratio. Pour the solution into the impression at an unimportant place e.g. a corner of the frame to avoid damage to the impression due to pouring. It should be allowed to flow slowly till it fills the impression to a uniform thickness of about 1/2 an inch.   
(vi) Reinforce the cast at this stage with wire gauze pieces and pour the remaining solution till it acquires a thickness of about one inch.   
(vii) The cast is allowed to set for 10-15 minutes. With the copying pencil engrave the details of the case on the mould including case number, date, police station, location, right or left foot, time of recording, person responsible for recording, signature of the investigating officer and signature of the witnesses. A sample of the plaster of paris and soil should be preserved for obtaining test prints of the suspect under similar conditions.

(vili) Remove the retaining walls (wooden frame) by digging away the surrounding earth and gently slip your fingers under the cast to lift it very carefully. Pour water over it to remove any adhering earth particles. Care should be taken not to brush it to prevent obliteration of the details of the footprints.

# Police Telecommunication & Wireless System

# Introduction

219. Communication is said to be the lifeblood of any organization. It is more so with regard to an organization like police, which has to deal with innumerable situations of predictable and unpredictable nature. The communication system of such an organization has to be effective, efficient, dynamic, quick and clear. The traditional mode of police communication is known as wireless system. This traditional mode, in due course of time, obtained a new dimension in the form of telecommunication, and today, this system consists of a variety of modes and methods used for receiving and sending messages, in addition to the traditional communication methods.

# Objective

220. In order to facilitate quick communication among various police officers and the police units of the State, as also among the similar units of other States, and police units through the inter-state police network, a system of communication is set up at the level of various State Police Organizations and the CPOs. The basic purpose of such communication system is to handle official messages particularly with regard to situation pertaining to maintenance of law and order and issues dealing with prevention, detection and investigation of crimes and other important policing and official business. It can be used by other government departments for passing on messages or information of urgent nature. In times of emergency when normal facilities of communication, such as postal, telegraphic and telephonic systems get interrupted due to strikes, storms and sabotage, the police wireless system can be used in the public interest.

# Structure

221. The structure of police telecommunication and wireless system is divided in two categories: the Headquarter and field formations. The headquarter of police telecommunication/wireless system is mostly situated at the State capital and is headed by an officer of the rank of Additional D.G./IGP, who is often an officer of the IPS cadre, though at times, the chief of the police wireless/telecommunication system could also be an officer from the wireless cadre. An officer of the rank of Additional SP/DSP is made in charge of the regional wireless unit. At the district level an officer of the rank of DSP/ Inspector, who is under the overall control of the district SP looks after the work of police wireless system. At the level of police headquarter and State control rooms officers of the rank of Additional SP/DSP/Inspector are posted to look after the work of police wireless system as per the quantum and work load to be handled by each unit.

# Classification & Type

222. Police telecommunication and wireless system is classified into the following four categories:

A. High Frequency Communication B. Very High Frequency Communication C. Landline Communication D. Electronic, Internet and Cyber Communication

# A. High Frequency Communication

223. HF Communication is a long distance communication existing between the State Capital and all the District Hqrs. The main mode of the Communication in this system is Radio Telephony and Morse. This system is being utilized as a standby communication arrangements. Static HF radios sets, capable of voice communication are established at each district headquarter and at identified strategic places. These can be shifted anywhere, temporarily in emergency situation.

# B. Very High Frequency Communication

224. VHF Communication system is a line of sight Communication provided within the district. The District Hqrs. is linked with all the Police Stations of the District. The VHF Mobile Communication is also extended to the Police Officers of and above the rank of Inspectors. Almost all the Police Stations as well as important Police Outposts in the states are provided with VHF Communication.

# C. Landline Communication

225. State Police Wireless is also providing Land Line Communication, on Lines leased from the department of telecommunication, which work round the clock. Besides Land Line telephonic communication, other modes like tele printers, telephones, hot Line speech circuits, there are other systems like ECCR Exchanges, Fax Communication, Police Telephone Exchanges (EPABX), Paging services, VHF Radio Trunk-Line system and Mobile Telephone Systems are also operated and maintained by the wireless system of the police department.

# D. Electronic, Internet and Cyber Communication

226. Introduction, adaptation, application and implementation of various computerization schemes by the police departments has led to the initiation and popularization of new communication system in the police department, which is popularly known as the electronic, internet and cyber communication. All units of the police departments have been or are being covered by computer system and the wide and local area networking system has brought in the system of online communication in the official working of the police departments. Email, internet, teleconferencing modes of cyber communication are obtaining popularity in the police department on account of their specific features like speed, connectivity, clarity, confidentiality and online communicability of the systems. The police wireless department plays an important and significant role in the introduction, implementation, maintenance and efficient functioning of this new system of police communication.

Similarly, various other administrative parameters pertaining to subjects and issues like rewards and punishments, transfers, inspections etc., should also be separately formulated. Keeping in view the special coordination contexts and regular interaction situations required maintaining contacts with the civil police and other units, specific guidelines in this regard should be formulated.

# Message Writing Instructions

232. The officers entitled to use Police Communications Network should send only the messages pertaining to Law & Order, crime prevention, investigation, prosecution and all connected matters therewith. Messages about natural calamities, accidents and missing of persons, women or children, dissemination of information or criminal intelligence also come within the purview of Law & Order, for the purposes of use of the Radio Grid. The communication staff has instructions not to accept any messages, which does not relate to the above. A detailed list of subjects, pertaining to L&O, semi Law & Order etc. on which messages are to be originated should be spelt only by the authorized officer.

232.1 Radio messages should be treated on a par with telegrams, and messages conveying information, which could normally go by post, should be avoided. Messages must be written legibly/type written in the standard police message form. Oral and casual instructions to operators, for transmitting messages, should be avoided.

232.2 Messages should not be communicated by telephone to the operating staff for transmission over the grid. However, messages may be conveyed over telephone in case of any emergency followed by a written confirmation.

232.3 Normally, each message should be sent in duplicate to the Radio station, one copy of which will be retained in the Radio station and the other returned to the sender with acknowledgement. In case of messages addressed to more than one authority the number of copies required would be the number of nets on which the messages have to be transmitted plus an office copy to be returned to the sender with acknowledgement. The officer-in-charge of the Radio station should be consulted as to the number of copies required for transmission to multiple addressees. This will avoid delay, in as much as no time would be wasted in the Radio station in making out copies of the messages for transmission by different nets.

232.4 The following instructions should be borne in mind while writing up messages.

i. Address to: Designation of the official and/or name of the department along with the name of the Station should be inserted here. If approved abbreviated addresses are available, they should invariably be used. Under no circumstances should titles, prefix or suffix be used.   
ii. Address for information (Info): If the message is also required to be sent to any authority other than the addressee for information only, the name or designation of the official or the name of department together with the name of the station should be inserted in this space. Approved abbreviated addressees, if available should be used.   
ii. Address from(FROM): Name and/ or Designation of the official or name of the Department of the originator along with the name of the station should be entered here. If approved abbreviation is available it should be used.   
iv. Originator's Number: The originator should enter his reference number of the correspondence.   
v. Date: The date on which the message is originated should be entered in this space. The date may be written in figures separated by slashes only for example the $2 3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ of March 2002 will be written as 23/03/2002.

vi. In Reply to: The reference of the correspondence to which the message is in reply should be entered in this space. This eliminates use of common preamble in a letter. Example: "Reference is invited to your No... or "With reference to (abbreviated designation) No...

vii. Dated: The Date of reference shown in (vi) above namely "IN REPLY TO" should be entered in this space. It should be written only in figures as mentioned above under "date".

viii. Text: Owing to the large volume of traffic handled in a Radio station an unnecessarily lengthy message may cause delay and hold up other messages in the grid. It is essential to combine brevity with intelligibility. Before writing a message, consideration should be given to the contents carefully. The text should then be couched as briefly as possible in telegraphic language. The use of words like "Please", "Kindly", "Would be grateful" must be eliminated. Omission of these words in a Radio message does not imply lack of courtesy.

ix. The following punctuation signs only must be used: Full stop should be written within a circle, whether by hand or by type written, e.g. (.). No full stop is required at the end of the text. While Comma (,); Inverted Commas (" "); Hyphen (-); Oblique or Stroke or bar $( / )$ ; Brackets O; Decimal point (.) and Apostrophe () should be written in the same way as in ordinary writing. Apart from the above signs, no punctuation or mathematical signs should be written and care must be taken to ensure that their omission does not alter the sense of the message. On no account should the text contain tabular statements, as they cannot be transmitted by Radio.

x. Priority: If it is desired that a message should be transmitted more expeditiously than as ordinary message the degree of priority should be entered in this space. The categories of priority available and their use are given in the succeeding order.

xi. Originator's signature and designation: The originator should affix his signature and designation in this space signifying that he has approved the contents of the message including the priority classification, if any, and authorized its transmission by Radio. Messages not signed by an authorized person will not be accepted for transmission by Radio.

xii. Time of origin (TOO): The time (in figures) at which the originator signs a message should be inserted in this space. The first two figures indicate the hours and the next two, the minutes. Thus, five minute past six $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { O } ^ { \prime }$ clock in the morning is written as

0605. The Abbreviation Hrs., should not be used. In all cases "Time Of Origin" (TOO) must be entered by the originator. xii. The remaining spaces in the message form are for the use of the wireless staff only and the Originator should write nothing.

233. As all Radio transmissions are subject to interception by any person possessing a receiver, there is no security attached to the transmission of a message by Radio. Originators must therefore ensure that, if the contents of a message are of classified nature, the procedure elaborated in the succeeding paragraphs is followed. Following will be security classifications:

a) Top Secret (Top Sec) b) Secret (Secret) c) Confidential (Confd.)

a) Top Secret: Messages containing information of such vital nature that, for reasons of national security, it must not be disclosed to any one for whom it is not essential to have knowledge of it for the performance of his duty, and unauthorized disclosure of which would cause "Exceptionally grave damage to the Nation". This category is reserved for the Nation's closest Secrets and is used with great reserve.

b) Secret: Messages, the unauthorized disclosure of which would endanger national or internal security, cause serious injury to the interests or prestige of the nation or serious embarrassment to the Government, or would be of great advantage to a foreign nation. This classification should be used for highly important matters and is the highest classification ordinarily used.

Confidential: Messages, the unauthorized disclosure of which, while not endangering the national security, would be prejudicial to the interests of the nation, any Government activity or individual or would cause administrative embarrassment or difficulty or be of advantage to a foreign nation. Most matters will on popular analysis be not higher than "Confidential".

233.1 All Top Secret/Secret and Confidential messages will have to be encrypted and as such they should be sent in double envelopes to the signal office/Radio station. The inner envelope containing the classified message should be properly sealed, and should invariably be a new one while the outer envelope may bear an economy slip. The inner envelope should be marked with the Security classification i.e., Top Secret/Secret/Confidential together with appropriate priority. The outer envelope should bear only the address of the signal office/Radio station and will not have the Security classification of the contents marked on it. However, the outer envelope should clearly indicate that, it is a message for transmission by Police Radio and should also bear its priority. The Security classification should invariably be entered at the proper space in the Message form, before it is sealed.

233.2 Two skeleton copies of the message should also be attached to the sealed envelope containing a classified message. The skeleton copies will contain all details except the text of the message.

233.3 The person on duty in the Radio station will give a receipt of the message to the originator on one of the Skeleton copies with 'Paraphrase warning stamp' or OTP stamp' the paraphrase warning stamp makes it incumbent on the originator not to transmit the message without being paraphrased or to distribute the copies of the same to any unauthorized person. OTP stamp imposes no such restriction on the Originator.

233.4 A classified message should be sent to the Signal office through dependable couriers with utmost care and caution.

233.5 While originating a classified message, the Originator has the responsibility of determining whether a Radiogram is necessary or a letter or other form of communication would serve the purpose. He should grade the message appropriately. A Radiogram is given security classification according to the subject matter contained therein. It must be remembered that over grading of message is as harmful to security as under grading. Priority should be determined by the subject matter and the time factor involved in transmission and for action required to be taken by the addressee. Priority higher than what is absolutely necessary should not be given. Judicious use of priorities will assist the clearance of really urgent messages in time. The text and the address should be expressed correctly avoiding verbosity.

233.6 A Message, which has to be converted into a Cryptogram, has to be edited carefully, the principles involved being clarity, brevity, accuracy and security. Conversion of Radiogram into Cryptogram and transmission is a very tedious process. It also takes considerable time to handle such messages. It is, therefore, imperative that, only such classified messages should be sent over Police Radio for transmission, which cannot be cleared by other means of communication. The Originators should also be prepared for the consequent delays that take place in the process of encryption/decryption.

# Use of Priorities

234. Normally, messages are cleared according to the serial order of their receipt at a Radio station. However, to ensure faster clearance, the messages are given priorities (a) CRASH (b) MOST IMMEDIATE (c) IMMEDIATE (d) ORDINARY, according to the urgency and importance of the message.

(a) Crash: When a message of this priority is received, communication on all concerned channels is suspended forthwith to clear the message. This priority is restricted to extreme emergencies and should, therefore, be resorted to, only in very exceptional circumstances. This priority must be used when interruption of other urgent traffic is justified. This priority is to be used where the recipient has to take immediate action to save human lives or to prevent damage to valuable property or immediate apprehension of criminals. All persons authorized to use the grid may use this priority- only in very grave emergencies.

(b) Most Immediate: This priority is restricted to messages conveying information or instructions relating to natural calamities, disturbances, (communal, anti-social and political), strikes, accidents, riots, murder security measures, criminal information and important movements of the police, which in the opinion of the Originator, should reach the addressee immediately.

(c) Immediate: This is restricted to messages conveying important information relating to law & order and crime for immediate attention and action, for instance, information regarding probability of strikes, disturbances or any

other upheaval, movements of high Government officials dealing with law & order, political leaders, agitators and dangerous criminals. (d) Ordinary: This category is used for messages of routine nature, which do not come under any of the above categories, but are connected with law & order and crime, which are urgent enough to justify the use of Radio network.

234.1 The instances mentioned are not exhaustive but only illustrative. The Originator should consider each case and assign the minimum priority compatible with the requirement. However, with a view to ensure the correct priorities, the specified officers only are authorized to use the priorities

234.2 Only the minimum priority compatible with the circumstances of the case should be used, and if an officer is authorized to use a particular priority, it does not imply, he should use that priority in respect of all messages originated by him. Officers may use higher priorities, which they are not normally permitted in exceptional cases, if it justifies such use.

234.3 The working schedule of District H.F. link is limited and also the reliability of communication depends upon the climatic conditions. All officers shall be strictly instructed not to originate messages on routine matters. All unit officers should see that there is no mechanical repetition of messages received from Chief Office or DGP or other senior officers. They should study the messages and take appropriate action and communicate only those, which are required to be communicated for the requisite compliance.

# Schedule of Working Hours

235. The Main Police Communication Network, linking various district headquarters to the State Police Head quarters should work from 0800 to 2200 hours on all days of the week. The Communication networks linking sub-divisional and Circle Hqrs., stations to the concerned District Head Quarters should work from 0700 to 1200 Hrs and 1500 to ${ 2 0 0 0 } \mathrm { H r s }$ , on all days of the week. All the Communications Networks will work extended hours whenever required. They will also work round-the-clock, in times of emergency.

# Radio Telephony

236. All Police Stations and officers up to the rank of Inspectors should be provided with VHF communication facility for quick exchange of information related to Law & Order,

crime prevention and investigation, extremist activities and anti-smuggling operations etc..   
with the following Radio equipment.   
A. VHF Static Station: Consists of VHF set, 12V battery, float charger and G.P. antenna supported by a mast.   
B. Mobile Station: Consists of VHF set, 12V battery and a whip antenna   
C. Handheld set: Consists of a VHF Transreceiver with Ni-Cd battery and helical antenna.

236.1 The SHO of PS is responsible for the safe custody of the static station equipment. The officer to whom a mobile station or a hand held set is provided is responsible for its safe custody. The Inspector of Police Communications is responsible for accounting and or carrying out repairs of the equipment.

236.2 The working schedule for VHF station should be from 0600 hrs to 2200 Hrs continuously depending on local requirements. They may also work extended hours or roundthe-clock, if needed.

236.3 The Constables provided by the SHO should operate the static station. The SHO should respond to the calls whenever he is present in the station. Officers should respond from the mobile/handheld sets whenever they are called. They should be well conversant with the handling and maintenance of equipment. They have to ensure daily maintenance of equipment. If any defect is noticed, they should inform to the Control station as well as Inspector Communications. They should pursue the matter with Inspector Communications till the technical staff rectifies the defect.

236.4 Officers provided with Mobile/Handheld VHF sets send their batteries to the nearby HF station for charging and ensure that no communication breakdown occurs due to discharged battery.

236.5 Every care should be taken to protect the VHF equipment. In case it is lost or damaged it should be immediately reported to the concerned Communication Officer.

Equipment should always be safeguarded from drenching in rainy season. Untrained and unauthorized persons should not be allowed to handle the set and set should be used only for official conversation.

# Radio Telephony Procedure

237. While making conversation on radiotelephony one should listen carefully before transmission and ensure prompt and intelligent reply to the calls while observing grid discipline and obtain permission from the Control station to contact any other station in the grid.

237.1 The pressal switch should not be pressed more than one minute and hand set should not be pulled and the calls should be constructed in the sequence i.e. call sign of the station called phrase. From and call sign of the station calling example while transmitting operator should always bear in mind the rhythm, speed, volume and pitch (RsVP) to ensure maximum intelligibility? Figures and difficult words should be repeated using phrase I say again. Phonetic alphabets must be used to spell out a word-using phrase I spell.

# Other Important Aspects:

239. Some of the other important aspects pertaining to police wireless and telecommunication system are follow:

A. Location and Protection of Radio Stations   
B. Movements of Radio Stations.   
C. Delivery of Radio Messages.   
D. Use of Police Communication Network in Emergencies. E.  Inter-State Police Radio Network

# A. Location and Protection of Radio Stations

240. All the fixed Radio stations should be located in the DPO, Reserve Police Hqrs., or in Police stations, establishments where guards are available. The Mobile Radio Stations, when taken by officers on tour, should also be located at such places where guard is available, and if not possible, in the building premises where the officer using the Mobile station, is camping. No other locations are permissible. Radio installations should be treated as vital and protected areas and their security is the responsibility of the SP and CPs concerned.

# B. Movements of Radio Stations

241. A fixed Radio Station cannot be shifted normally. In case of any emergency, it can be shifted on the orders of the Director, Police Communications/Director General of Police. This requires the approval of Ministry of Communications Government of India as per the Licensing conditions.

# C. Delivery of Radio Messages

242. At the State Police Head Quarters, cycle or foot messengers will deliver Radio Messages intended for officers located near the Master Communication Control station. Motorcycle messengers will deliver messages meant for officers, who are far away. In the districts, the District Superintendents of Police/Commissioners of Police, will provide motor cycle/cycle/foot messengers, preferably 3 or 4 for Zonal Head quarters, 2 or 3 for District

Head quarters and one for each sub division/Circle Head Quarters station to enable prompt delivery of messages. They will also provide messengers for Mobile radio stations installed in their jurisdictions.

# D. Use of Police Communication Network in Emergencies

243. The Police Communication Network should be normally employed only for the transmission of messages pertaining to matters as defined by the authorities from time to time. In times of anticipated emergencies, the prior approval of the Ministry of Communication, Government of India, should be obtained through the Directorate of Coordination, Police Wireless, New Delhi, for the use of Police Communication network for the purposes other than those, for which the Police Radio station are licensed. But in times of sudden emergency, like floods, cyclones and other such natural calamities the Chief Secretary to the State Government can authorize the use of Police Communication network for passing messages pertaining to those events in anticipation of the sanction of the Government of India. The post-facto sanction of the Ministry of Communication, Government of India should however be obtained, as quickly as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Such sanction may even be obtained over the Police Wireless in case the Posts and Telegraph channels go out of commission, due to disturbances.

# E. Inter-State Police Radio Network

244. This service will be utilized by all Police Officers, District Collectors and Secretaries to the Government, for the transmission of messages pertaining to all Police matters particularly crime prevention, investigation, Law & Order and Security matters. Through the State capitals the messages could be passed to all places provided with Radio Stations in the various states. The Police Communications networks in other states and the National capital are to be utilized for fast, reliable and secure communication and interchange of information including that relating to crime and criminals.

# Officers Authorized to use Wireless Facilities

245. Only the authorized persons can use the wireless communication facilities. The State Government, DGP and DPC will issue instructions in this regard and would be authorized to issue modifications as and when required. No person, except the ones, who are included in such lists, should be allowed to make use of wireless facility.

# Role and Duty of District Superintendent of Police

246. The police wireless organization is an independent unit of the police department and it functions to facilitate the working and communication among the various police and other units. The wireless stations, therefore, are stationed at various places in the jurisdiction of the concerned police district. The district superintendent police exercises immediate command, control and supervision over the wireless staff and stations situated in his jurisdiction.

246.1 The district SP performs these functions: drawl of pay and allowances and TA of the district Wireless personnel, grant increments, pay the electricity bills and provide contingent grant to the Wireless stations for meeting the expenditure towards the purchase of distilled water, etc., supply petrol and oil to the Wireless stations; issue LPC and transmit service records of the Wireless personnel transferred from the district, sanction casual leave to the Wireless personnel, supply stationery articles required for Wireless stations, supply furniture required for wireless stations, provide suitable accommodation for the location of the Wireless Station, provide Police transport for mobile Wireless stations, supervise the proper functioning of the Wireless stations and the work of the Wireless personnel and report to the Superintendent of Police, Wireless, cases of irregularities for taking necessary action.

# Chapter 15

# Railway Police

# Introduction

247. Indian Railways play a significant role in the various national, social and economic aspects of our country. People accept and use them as important mode of transportation. They are used as popular, convenient and economical mode of transporting human beings and goods of various types from one place to another. However, the Indian Railways are susceptible to crime situations and may be affected by law and order and disorders of various kinds. This has necessitated introduction of some security system to protect the railways from the attacks of criminals, anti-social elements and saboteurs. The Railway Police plays an important role in this regard.

# Organization and Structure of Railway Police

248. The Railway Police is a branch of the general police force of the State and is, therefore, subject to the various orders, instructions and rules, which are applicable to the personnel of State police organization. Like civil police, the Railway Police is also structured at the apex, district and field formation levels. An officer of the rank of Additional DGP/IGP, who is an integral part of the Police Headquarter, heads the Railway Police organization. The Railway Police organization in a State may be divided in one or more districts as per the requirements and workload. The Ralway Police district is further divided into various units like circles, police stations and OPs like the civil police. The jurisdiction of Railway Police extends to the Railway limits defined for this purpose.

# Role, Functions and Duties

249. The overall role of the Railway Police is to prevent, detect and investigate crimes committed in their jurisdiction, maintained order, collect and communicate criminal intelligence and apprehend the wanted persons within their jurisdiction. Broadly speaking the functions and duties of the Railway Police can be divided into two categories:

a) Prevention, registration, investigation and detection of crimes. b) Maintenance of order

# a) Prevention, registration, investigation and detection of crimes.

i. This would include registration of cognizable cases, arrest of suspects, criminal and absconders, detection and investigation of cognizable offences within the jurisdiction Of the Railway Police.   
ii. Inquiry and report under Section 132 of the Indian Railways Act.   
iii. The prosecution of cognizable offences under IPC, Railway Act and other Acts wherever applicable.   
iv. The reporting of all instances of illegal activities including fraud on the part of railway subordinates and others. v. Travelling in trains where VIPs and other selected officer's travel to watch out for suspicious persons.   
vi. Coordination with civil police to minimize crimes in the jurisdiction of Railway Police.   
vii. Collection, and communication of criminal intelligence, interception and arrest of wanted persons.

# b) Maintenance of order

i. Control of passenger traffic inside the station premises, more particularly on the platforms, in the booking offices, waiting halls and at the entrance and exit gates, and wherever specially required on emergencies by the station officials, the control of vehicular and other traffic in the station compound, the maintenance of order in standing passenger trains, prevention of overcrowding, etc, and watching loaded passenger trains when standing in stations.   
ii. The arrest of those found committing nuisances or suffering from infectious diseases and keeping the station premises clear of idlers and beggars.   
iii. The examination of all empty carriages on arrival at terminal stations for property left behind by passengers.   
iv. Removal of bodies of persons dying in the trains and in station premises and conveyance of sick passengers to hospital.   
v. Communicate information of any agitation likely to obstruct movement of trains, destruction of Railway property or installations to local police and help them to maintain law and order.

# Organization of the Railway Police Station

250. The Railway Police Station is divided into the following two sections:

a) The Traveling and the Detective Staff. b) The platform staff

# a) The Traveling and the Detective Staff.

250.1 The role and duties of the traveling and detective staff can be discussed under the following heads:

i. Beats of the Traveling Staff.   
ii. Organization of train beats and station patrols.   
iii. Duties of beat constables.   
iv. Mufti constables.

# i. Beats of the Traveling Staff.

251. A travelling constable's beat consists of the train by which he travels from his station over a prescribed length of line and the train by which he returns to his station. The serial numbers, of the trains, which form a beat, should be entered in the Duty Roster. Beat constables should report themselves at the Railway Police Station and Outposts en route and at the termination of their beats. In all the Railway Police Stations and Outposts, there will be a point book and the beat constables should sign in this book after their reporting at the station or outpost noting therein the train number, the date and also their numbers. Beat constable on trains proceeding beyond the State to the other States will be relieved at the points indicated by the authorized officer, in consultation with his counter-parts of the neighboring States.

# ii. Organization of train beats and station patrols.

252. There are certain obvious handicaps and difficulties in the detection of railway offences. Offences committed in trains are, as a rule, discovered by victims many miles from the place of their occurrence and the investigator, too, has generally no means of ascertaining the exact scene. Furthermore, Railway Police Officers, whose jurisdictions are confined to railway premises, have often to carry on investigations in places where their local knowledge is limited and their local influence negligible. This explains why practically all offences detected in the Railway Police districts are those in which culprits are caught red-handed.

252.1 The effective way of combating crime on railways is to use preventive methods, such as efficient beats and patrols, aimed on the one hand, at deterring criminals from operating in trains and railway station premises, and enhancing the probability of their being caught redhanded in the event of their committing crime on the other.

252.2 Train beats and station patrols should, therefore, be organized with due regard to crime position in the jurisdiction of each Railway Police Station. The senior police officers should during their monthly visits to stations must see that beats are well organized. The Superintendent of Police, Railways must to see that train beats are organized in a systematic manner, operated regularly and checked frequently. In this connection, it should be remembered that the bulk of the crime on railways consists of thefts in running passenger trains, thefts on platforms, in passengers' waiting rooms and stationary trains, thefts on running goods trains, thefts from goods sheds and stationary wagons and thefts of railway materials.

252.3 Thefts in running passenger trains are generally committed by persons who board the train at one station and escape at another, having committed one or more thefts in between. Such offences are mostly committed at night. If constables on platform and train beat duties are alert, it should not be difficult to prevent and detect such offences, particularly by old offenders known to the police. It is the primary duty of the constables on beat duty to keep a keen lookout for suspicious strangers and known registered criminals visiting railway stations and travelling by trains. It is, of course, important that beat constables should be able to identify by sight all old offenders who had committed railway offences in the past. When they come across old offenders or suspicious strangers in trains or station premises, they should interrogate them as to the purpose of their journey or visits, as the case may be, and if they are not able to give satisfactory account of their movements or articles in their possession, they should be arrested under Section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and sent up for remand. This will help to combat thefts not only in running trains but also on platform and in passenger's waiting rooms and stationary trains.

252.4 In order to prevent thefts on platforms, in passengers' waiting rooms and stationary trains, there should be beats covering station premises for about half an hour before the arrival and half an hour after the departure of every passenger train. At stations where there are night or early morning trains, there should be patrols throughout the night, as passengers may come to the station in the early hours of the night and sleep there. It is not, however, the intention that there should be a beat in every station. Thefts in passenger sheds, stationary trains and on platforms generally occur only at certain important stations. A study of the past crime will show which the stations that require platform are and passengers' waiting room beats. Platform beats should not be served throughout the day and night as a general rule, as this obviously involves avoidable waste of manpower.

252.5 The only effective method of preventing thefts from running goods trains is by the provision of armed guards to goods trains at night in sectors where such offences are common. But, the provision of armed guards on such trains is the responsibility of the Railway Protection Force, and the Railway Police will undertake this work only under exceptional circumstances.

252.6 Thefts from goods sheds and stationary wagons can be prevented by efficient police patrols. At important stations where there will be wagons stabled in large numbers, there should be such patrols throughout the day and night. But, in other places, constables on platform duty should be able to look after goods sheds and stationary wagons also.

252.7 Police should maintain a general vigilance in regard to railway materials. But, if train, yard and platform beats are efficiently performed, thefts of railway materials can be automatically controlled.

252.8 Police constable should be detailed for travelling duty by rotation and kept on beat duty for a month at a time. The travelling staff should be kept up to strength even at the expense, if necessary, of the platform staff. The SP Railways will make transfers from and posting to the travelling staff. Police constables of the travelling staff, as a rule are to be exempt from travelling every third day, when they will perform platform duty, if not otherwise detail.

# iii. Duties of beat constables.

253. Beat constables should always wear uniform. At every station, they should meet the Station Master and ask whether he wishes to make any report or complaint and obtain his initials in the beat book. When time admits, they will walk from end to end of the train making observations. At important specified stations where there are point books, the beat constables should sign in the point books noting therein the train number, the date and also their metal numbers and police station. They should also note in their beat books the page number and line number of the point book where they have signed. On returning from the beat, they will return the beat books to the officer-in-charge of the station.

253.1 As an additional precaution, the railway train guard should be required to inform the travelling beat constables by writing in his beat book the train number, date and number of each carriage in which accommodation is reserved for women only, particularly when women passengers travel alone. The beat constables should obtain signature or initials of the train guard for this entry. The beat constable will be required to search the off-sides and the underneath of the compartments and to maintain a watch at each stopping place particularly at the time of the departure of the train to ensure that no one is travelling on foot boards or couplings. Whether these duties would require an increase in strength will be determined by the circumstances then existing. Both the train guard and the travelling beat constable should be held responsible for carrying out this order.

# iv. Mufti constables.

254. In addition to beat constables, constables in mufti may be employed to travel by train on detective duty, such as shadowing suspects. The Railway Police are not responsible for watch and ward duties but they should patrol station yards and goods sheds when criminals are suspected to be operating, and there is reason to believe that unreported thefts are being committed.

# b) The platform staff

255. The chief duties of the platform staff are: maintenance of order at the railway station and watching of suspicious characters when trains with passengers are halting. Where there is sufficient staff, the platform from the point of view of police duties will be divided into various sectors and the police staff will perform their duties in their specific sectors while keeping contact with the staff of adjoining sectors. Duty rosters will be maintained for the staff and requisite entries and instructions will be mentioned therein. The Railway Stations, which are manned by two constables, one of them will stand at the gate and observe and keep a watch on the passengers movements and the other one will keep a watch on the train and its various carriages to prevent any criminal or any other unwarranted happening and movements of the people.

# Work Procedure

256. Police Stations, Outposts, Investigation Units should be located on the platform of the main Railway Station building at a convenient spot. The office accommodation for supervisory officers should be provided near the Railway Stations. The Police Stations, Investigation Units and supervisory officer should be linked with Railway Communication Network.

256.1 For on the spot registration of cases, arrests of accused, and for taking up investigation immediately, where possible, mobile police stations should be arranged. In the absence of such arrangements, facility must be provided to receive reports and pass on to the nearest Railway Police Station. Mobile Police station can be arranged in all important passenger trains with sufficient staff including beat patrols.

256.2 All cognizable cases, serious losses of property, all offences falling under Section 126 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (Act IX of 1890), and other important occurrences reported at the outside railway stations should be communicated at once to the Station House Officers of the concerned Railway Police Stations and also to the nearest District Police Station and to the Superintendent of Police, Railways, by the senior member of the platform staff or the beat constable. The descriptive particulars of the property should also be communicated to all railway police stations on the line and connecting lines. When the Station House Officer is absent from his headquarters, all reports of the above nature received in the station should be telegraphed to him. Station House Officers should telegraph serious cases and occurrences to the Circle Inspector/Sub-Divisional Police Officer and the Superintendent of Police, Railways. Likewise, the Circle Inspector should communicate to the Sub-Divisional Police Officer and to the Superintendent of Police, Railways, of any information, which he considers should be reported.

256.3 All grave crimes and offences under Sections 126, 127, 128 and 129 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (Act IX of 1890) and strikes or attempted strikes of railway employees should also be communicated to the District Magistrate concerned, followed by an express report.

256.4 As regards offences under Section 128 of the Railways Act, they may be treated as minor acts and no report need be sent. However, offences under Sections 127 and 128 of the Railways Act committed by any political party or in an organised manner with a motive to wreck the train and thus cause damage or hurt to a train or person should be reported to the Director General and ADG immediately by wireless, followed by detailed reports, in addition to reports being sent to the concerned officers.

256.5 For communication apart from telephones, telegrams also could be used. Telegrams concerning Railway cases should be sent on railway service and other telegrams as State message. Where there is a Police Wireless Station report should be sent by wireless and not by telegrams.

256.6 The superior officer should at once proceed to the scene of occurrence and conduct the investigation on receiving the report of any case coming under Section 126 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (Act IX of 1890), which involves danger to human life. He should also send a copy of the report of his investigation to the District Magistrate concerned. Such cases must be very thoroughly investigated with the co-operation of the district police.

256.7 In the matter of complaints or information reported by railway officials by telegram, the telegram should be confirmed by a further report in writing.

# Shortages and Lost Property

257. The police should not register information of shortages or of the loss or missing of property as crimes, or proceed to make an investigation according to the Criminal Procedure Code upon such information, unless there is reasonable suspicion that a cognizable offence has been committed in connection with the loss of the articles. They should, however, register such information in the Station House Diary and take whatever steps can, to trace the missing articles.

257.1 In order to ensure that proper steps have been taken to trace missing articles, a register in the Form will be maintained in Railway Police Stations, entries being made immediately on receipt of the information about the loss or shortage.

257.2 Separate entries, either in separate registers or in different parts of a common register, will be made for shortage or loss of goods or parcels, shortage or loss of railway materials, loss of property of passengers. Entries will clearly distinguish whether the shortage or loss occurred in a stationary wagon, a wagon in transit or from a transshipment shed or platform. When making entries in the register, care should be taken to note whether a report against any railway official was sent to the railway authorities and the action taken by them thereon.

257.3 Station House Officer can himself dispose of any case of shortage or loss amounting to a maximum of Rs. 100. The orders of the Circle Inspector should be obtained where the value exceeds Rs. 100 but is within Rs. 500. In other cases, the orders of the superior Police Officer should be obtained.

257.4 Particular attention will be paid by inspecting officers to the action taken and enquiries made by the Station House Officer in regard to such shortages and losses. The register will also include reports, which the Station House Officer transfers to another jurisdiction. He should state his reason for such action and his Circle Inspector should ratify this.

# Nuisances and Petty Thefts

258. The Railway Police must deal with all nuisances committed within the railway limits. Care must be exercised in the matter of refusing to investigate petty thefts on the ground of the small value of the articles stolen.

# Entering Upon Investigation

259. The Railway Police are bound to investigate all crimes and occurrences, which the police are required by the Criminal Procedure Code to investigate.

259.1 The superior officer should at once proceed to the scene of occurrence and conduct the investigation on receiving the report of any case coming under Section 126 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (Act IX of 1890), which involves danger to human life. He should also

send a copy of the report of his investigation to the District Magistrate concerned. Such cases must be very thoroughly investigated with the co-operation of the district police.

# Inquest Report and disposal of Dead Bodies

260. In cases of death (whether by railway accident or otherwise), within railway limits, in which an investigation is held under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code, an extract of the investigation reports in the Form will be forwarded to the District Engineer, in all cases, and the District Traffic Superintendent also, in cases occurring within the limits of a railway station. In the event of the investigation having been held by the District Police, a copy of the report will be obtained from them and forwarded to the railway officials concerned.

260.1 The Railway Police should take steps to hand over the body of any person who has been killed or has died within railway limits to the relatives or failing them, to any friend of the deceased, or, if for any reason, that is not possible, to the member of any society or institution willing to perform the last rites for such person; and if none of these agencies undertake the task, the Railway Police should be responsible for the burial or cremation in a proper manner and in accordance with the nationality and religion of the deceased, the cost being defrayed by the Superintendent of Police, Railways, from his contingent charges.

# Record in Registers

261. The Railway Police functions generally on the style and pattern adopted by the civil police, therefore, the record and the registers maintained by the Railway Police Station happened to be similar to the civil police. However, specific registers and records like Station Crime History consisting of crime, occurrences and classification registers, crime charge and general information registers and records should be maintained by each railway stations in the contexts of their specific crime situations.

# Coordination and Cooperation

262. Railway Police have to deal with various crimes of continuing and floating nature.

267.3 On the occurrence of a serious accident, the Station House Officer of the Railway Police should mobilize the staff of this station and have them taken to the spot. If the staffs of one station are insufficient, the Inspector should mobilize other stations also. The Railway Police should guard the property and help the injured persons. The District Police will also send police parties to the spot to assist the Railway Police in guarding the property and helping the injured. The Inspector in his diary should mention in the Station House Diary and all cases of accident, injury and death occurring on the railway also.

267.4 While the responsibility for preventing accidents at level crossings and elsewhere on the railway rests with the railway servants, Railway Police Officers should, whenever any inquiry discloses the existence of a danger to the public, take steps to bring the fact prominently to the notice of the Station master or higher authority concerned.

A copy of the findings of the Government Inspector of Railways, as per his final report, will be sent to the Superintendent of Police, Railways, within seven days of its receipt by the General Manager. The Superintendent of Police, Railways, will consider the report and informs the General Manager within seven days, whether or not a prosecution is to be launched.

# Investigation and Prosecution in Railway Accident

268. A close examination of the scene gives clues to the cause of accident. The scene must be guarded as far as possible undisturbed to protect from offenders concealing evidence of negligence or other defects. Steps must be taken to restore the track, moving the injured to hospital, completion of inquests on dead bodies. Presence of sufficient number of Head Constables, ASIs and Sis should be ensured at the spot for holding of Inquest and other activities including investigation.

268.1 Local Police and RP Station should shift injured to hospital if already not done by others. If they are already sent to hospital send either the local Police SI or HC to examine the injured in the hospital and report. Photographer attached with the Investigating Team should take photographs and videograph in the prescribed manner. A small team, particularly those who are good at observation to examine the track on both ends of the scene and sides for some distance to locate the exact spot from where the derailment started should be deputed. If for example nuts and bolts are found lying, collect them and also collect the other nuts and bolts still remaining unfastened or partially unfastened or damaged from near the place where the earlier ones are collected. Also collect control sample of earth. Any pieces of the Engine, wheels, fittings or any object for that matter including ballast pieces, which have any clue, should be collected. It may not be possible to list all items, which may be collected, as it depends on the circumstances of each case.

268.2 Personally go over the whole scene and study the reports being given from time to time by the staff deputed. Set up a camp office near the scene or a convenient place from where Investigation can be directed. The spot should be near the same spot where other senior officers like SRP or IGP, Zonal IGP/DIGP etc. have set up a control center for directing operations. Requisition and ensure Inspection by expert from Forensic Science Laboratory or Other expert body through the Director, FSL.

268.3 Examine all witnesses including Railway officials and informant of the accident at the spot by detailing teams if number is too large. The entire Railway staff on the train including the driver and of the neighboring stations should be examined. The local people who first come to the spot should also be examined besides any other relevant witness.

268.4 The damages caused to the track, carriages and the exact scene as it looks from its observation giving distances etc. should be noted and sketch should be drawn up containing 1O's observations.

268.5 After the staff deputed on various assignments have given their reports, the scene has been completely examined, Inquests completed, injured sent to hospital and available witnesses examined, clearance should be given for track restoration and clearing of debris. Unlike other cases where there may be some time available, Railway accidents do not admit of any delay in the matter of track restoration except to the extent absolutely necessary. The officers who have been given different assignments may be returned to their other work after they have submitted their reports.

# Enquiry by Chief Commissioner/Commissioner of Railway Safety

269. The Commissioner of Railway Safety is the statutory authority according to Chapter 12 of the Railway Act to inquire into the cause of accident. His opinion is in the nature of an expert on the cause of accident just as a PM certificate or MVIs certificate in Motor accidents. It is therefore necessary that SRP/DSRP should furnish full and correct details. The SRP may seek any clarification from the enquiry report since the opinion in the report is vital. Prosecution may be launched only after receiving the Commissioner report.

269.1 A copy of the findings of the Commissioner for Safety will be sent to the Superintendent, Railway Police, within seven days of its receipt by the General Manager. The Superintendent Railway Police, will consider the report and inform the General Manger, within seven days, whether or not a prosecution is to be launched. In considering the report the SP, Railways or SP CID concerned who is entrusted with investigation should ask the team of investigators to go through the report and take their opinion into consideration.

269.2 After investigation is completed the process of consultation with APP/LA should be started and decision taken. The Addl. DGP CID is the authority to pass final orders on the cases of Railway Accidents with loss of life.

# Investigating Suspected Cases of Sabotage

270. Following points should be borne in mind by Investigating Officers in investigating cases of suspected sabotage:

# 1) Site of Accident and Time of Occurrence

(a) It should be examined whether the place of accident is a secluded area, at or near a gradient curve, bridge or culvert. Availability of covers for the saboteurs etc., to be examined.   
(b) Height of embankment at the sight to be measured.   
(c) Time of accident to be ascertained.

# 2) Open Fish-plates

(a) Determine whether it happened before or after the accident and differentiate between bolts opened by hand and machine from those torn off as a result of accident. Threads of bolts and nuts found at the scent will help in arriving at the correct conclusion.

(b) Displaced rails- (i) Examine screw holes and threads to see whether they are torn or intact. (ii) Examine whether rail seats are crushed.

(c) Last rail intact at the point of suspected fractures:

(i) Existence of burr is highly significant against sabotage   
(ii) Rounding off supports sabotage strongly;   
(iii)Position of wheels of derailed wagons is a matter of great importance and should be examined carefully as to whether the position of displaced rails could have been possible after the accident.   
(iv)Prepare carefully a map of the sight of accident. If railway plan drawers are used he should carefully check each item shown on the map.   
(v) Determination of speed at the time of accident (a) In case of through trains, the time of passing of previous station and the exact time of occurrence may give the possible and likely speed of the train at accident. (b) If the train had stopped at the previous station, the time of departure, the distance at which accident occurred and the time of accident, if known, may lead to very approximate calculations of the speed of the train.   
(vi)Braking distance, vacuum brakes, reaction time, visibility, weather condition and the depth of water by the side of embankment should be carefully noted, as it will affect decisions.   
(vii) The movements of suspicious characters and of known saboteurs should be verified.   
(viii) If track patrolling is in vogue in the area, ascertain at what time they passed at the spot of accident.   
(ix) Verify whether other trains passed shortly before the accident and if so, their drivers and guards should be questioned. Station records of both stations between which accident occurred should be seen immediately to prevent tampering of records.   
(x) Note whether the victim train was carrying any bullions, currency etc.   
(xi) Take the photographs of he sight of the accident from various angles and of various materials concerned. Make use of scientific aids for tools marks, fingerprints (latent), particles of exploded material if bomb is used, etc.

# Chapter 16

# Police Training System

# Introduction

281. Training happens to be an important instrument and process of human resources development. All departments and organizations, therefore, accept its significance and value for their growth and development. Police organization is not an exception to this general rule with regard to organizational development. Training stands for instruction and indoctrination in any art, professional and occupation. It is an amalgam of several distinct and specified components and elements. In short, training is the process of developing and transforming habits, skills, values, knowledge and attitudes of the employees for the purpose of increasing their effectiveness in their present assignments and preparing them for future needs.

# Police Perspective

282. The need for the training of police personnel has been recognized but developments in the past have underlined more strongly the urgency of inculcating in them atitudes appropriate to the new professional demands. In the changed contexts the police-training programme must aim at providing a professional leader ship, which can achieve the speedy transformation of an economically backward society into a secular, modern, technologically advanced society characterized by equal opportunity and social justice. Police training should help the trainees in creating a sense of involvement and participation at all levels. Such training should work as a change agent to bring about the requisite changes at the level of knowledge, skills, attitudes and values. The police training as a continuous process should help the police personnel in their overall career development and should acquaint them with their overall organizational and professional climate while familiarizing them with their overall professional milieu. The police training should, thus, be accepted as investment in the human resources and the limitations of the other personnel parameters and components should not be laid at the door of police training.

# Structure of Police Training System

283. There has been a perceptible change in the approach to the police training at various levels in the recent past. Police training is no longer an area of neglect and indifference. Quite a lot has been done to improve the state of police training in India, however, quite a lot remains to be done. The structural changes brought about in this respect prove that serious efforts are being made to improve the state of police training at various levels.

283.1 The training enterprise should be headed by a senior police officer of the rank of Addl. DG/IGP. This will provide status to the training system on the one hand and would give seriousness, maturity and experience to the training process on the other. At present most of the training enterprises at various levels are headed by the officers of the rank of DG/Add. DG. This practice should continue in future also in as much as, it will be in the overall interest of the police organization in general and the training system in particular. The apex level of the police training can be called as Directorate of police training. The Directorate of police training should exercise command, control and supervision over all the training institutions situated in the State/Unit.

# Functions of Training Directorate

284. The Police Training Directorate headed by an officer of the rank of Addl. DGP is an apex organization with regard to the various facets, functions, objectives and logistics pertaining to all type of police training activities of the respective State police organization. The functions of the Training Directorate are following:

i. Command, control, regulate, oversee and supervise all the training activities and training institutions in the State.   
ii. Ensure fulfillment and attainment of the aims, objectives, goals and targets of police training.   
ii. Improve the infrastructure and training facilities of each training institutions.   
iv. Provide dynamism, speed, goal direction and contemporary relevance to the training activities for bringing about requisite professionalism and competence in the police personnel of all ranks.   
v. Prepare the police trainees for the attainment and realization of the Mission Statement and Vision Statement of the respective police organization.   
vi. Conduct quality audit of the training activities.

vii. Ensure training worthiness of all the training institutions by enabling them to maintain the requisite standards with regard to competence of the police trainers, relevance of training methodology and appropriateness of the feedback and follow up mechanisms.

# Objectives of Police Training

285. The objectives of police training as a whole should be the following:

a) To prepare professionally sound and operationally competent policemen of various ranks   
b) To develop physical fitness and competence for handling various police equipment and weapons.   
c) To create an adequate level of awareness in the trainee participants, about their roles, responsibilities and duties, along with the requisite responsiveness and accountability expected from the policemen working in a democratic society   
d) To instill sound knowledge about law and procedure, so as to equip the trainees to handle their various tasks of order maintenance and crime management.   
e) To evolve requisite professional skills, so very essential to perform their roles in a democratic and free society   
f) To develop requisite attitudes, norms and values in the police trainees   
g) To foster loyalty to the Constitution, commitment to the aspirations of the nation, the concept of an egalitarian society, and the needs for national integration.   
h) To create an awareness in the policemen that they are friends of the people and they can win the confidence and cooperation of the community only with service orientation and by respecting the needs, demands and rights of the people.

# Police Training Institutions: A Classification

286. The police training institutions in India can be classified broadly under two heads:

a) Central Level Police Training Institutions b) State Level Police Training Institutions

286.1 The central level training institutions are under the command and control of the Govt. of India. These institutions are part of various central police organizations (CPOs). Each CPO maintains its own training schools and their location; type and variety would be in accordance with the professional needs of the respective CPO. These training schools primarily run the training courses for their own personnel, however, in the interest of capacity building of the personnel of the State police organization, these training institutions run some specific courses for them also. Thus, there is a coordinated effort of capacity building between the Central and State level training schools.

286.2 The State level police training institutions can be classified under the following three heads:

a) State or apex level b) Subordinate level c) Specialized level

286.3 The State level or the apex level training institutions are designated as academies or colleges, and they primarily run various training courses for the Gazetted officers, however, they also run specialized and specific courses for other ranks also. The officers of the various ranks like Addl. DG/ IGP/ DIGP should head these training institutions. The infrastructure, facilities, financial resources, training aids and equipment along with varied man-material resources of these institutions should be commensurate with their status, functions and quality training inputs expected from these institutions.

286.4 The next level of the police training institutions, which deal with the training needs and activities pertaining to the subordinate ranks and the constabulary are called Police Training Schools. The officers of the rank of DIG/SP/Addl should head these training schools, as per the nature, quality and type of training activities handled by them. Various training courses including the basic, foundational, refresher, re-orientation, specialized should be run by these training schools for the subordinate ranks and constabulary. These schools should be properly equipped in terms of man and material, aids and equipment and financial resources in keeping with their functional needs and demands.

286.5 The specialized training schools deal with the specific professional and training needs of various police units like traffic, wireless, special branch, and motor driving etc. The officers of reasonable rank, seniority, experience and competence should head these training schools. Training aids and equipment and other resources befitting their functional needs should be made available to the training schools.

286.6 In addition to the Central and State level training schools, the police officers are also provided with the opportunity to undergo foreign training conducted by various levels. The MHA and the BPR&D are the nodal agencies for handling these foreign-based training activities. Nomination to the various foreign training courses should be done with due caution and care and all efforts must be made to utilize the services of the trained officers in the specific areas in which they have obtained the foreign training.

# Nature of Police Training

287. The police training is basically divided into two categories, i.e., indoor training and outdoor training. The indoor training is inclusive of various subjects like:

a) Law and procedure   
b) Indian Constitution, major, minor and special acts   
c) Human behaviour, police behaviour, protection of human rights and the rights of minority groups, SC, ST, and backward classes   
d) Investigation, prevention and detection of crimes and criminology   
e) Scientific aids to investigation and role of forensic science and FSLs in the police working   
f) Organisation and functional framework and role of state police organization and CPOs   
g) Rules and Regulations of various types relevant for the police personnel   
h) Order maintenance and regulation of various law and order related activities   
i) Maintenance of internal security and handling of various security and safety related issues   
j) Handling of natural calamities and disaster management   
k) VIP security and protection of vital installations   
1) Perform various democratic duties and maintenance of effective and efficient public service delivery system

287.1 The outdoor police training is inclusive of subjects like:

1. Physical fitness and unarmed combat with offence and defense techniques   
2. Drill with and without arms   
3. Weapon training and mob dispersal   
4. Equitation and equestrian skills (mounted police)

# Types of Training Courses

288. The police training schools conduct the following courses for the various ranks:

1. Basic and Foundation training courses for directory recruited Constables, Subinspectors and DySPs.   
2. In addition to these foundational courses for civil police, armed police, short-term orientation courses as part of the foundational training are conducted for the personnel of tele-communication, mounted police, Armourers and MT staff of the Police Department. The period of basic training for Dy. SP and SIs should be of one year and that for the constables should be for 9 months. However, the period of training for lady constables could be of 6 months only.   
3. Short term training courses as part of the foundational courses for IPS officers and the personal of tele-communication, are also arDivision/Zoned in the various police training schools of Rajasthan.   
4. In addition to the foundational and basic training courses, promotion cadre course (PCC) for HCs, ASIs, Sis and Inspectors are organized by the police training schools. The duration of these PCC courses varies from 1/1-2 month to four months.   
5. Specialized short-term training courses on various aspects of police training in the form of Refresher courses or in the form of fresh courses should also be conducted by the police training schools for the respective ranks.   
6. The State police training schools and the CPO training schools also conduct various training courses for the policemen of other units as part of police capacity building measures.   
7. In addition to the above in house police training at various training schools, officers and men are sent for training to various police training centres of the country. Nominations for officers are made for training outside the State and also for vertical interaction courses and foreign training.

# Infrastructure Facilities, Training Aids and Equipment and Training Support Services

289. On the basis of the strength of each rank of the police department and the requirement of various types of training to the personnel of each rank, intake capacity of each training school should be fixed so as to avoid extra burden on the concerned institution and for ensuring quality and requisite standard of the training efforts and inputs. The capacity calculation can be done on the basis of parameters and norms fixed by the BPR&D in their Training Master Plan.

289.1 The infrastructure and training support facilities pertaining to indoor and outdoor training activities should also be in accordance with the parameters and norms recommended by the BPR&D in their Training Master Plans. The BPR&D has conducted a scientific study with regard to furniture requirement, equipment requirement, indoor and outdoor training space areas and other training support facilities. The State police organization should keep in mind and ensure that the requisite facilities for conducting various training activities are available to each police training institution.

# Trainers of Police Training Schools

290. The teachers, trainers, counselors and facilitators play a vital and significant role in the training process and execution of training activities. The quality of the trainer is greatly responsible for the success and impact of the training activities. The trainer, for any police training school, should therefore be selected with great caution and care. The malady of the present training system is that this significant area in the police department suffers with negligence and indifference. As a result, the training efforts fail to bring about the required change and competence in the police trainees. The poor impact of the competence and capacity building police training measures is natural to affect the efficiency, performance and image of police department.

290.1 The Gore Committee on police training had delved deep into this aspect of police competence and had recommended a variety of measures to improve upon the state of affairs with regard to trainers available to various police training schools. The incentives and extra motivation recommended for attracting capable, willing and suitable trainers for the police training schools should be implemented.

290.2 Outsourcing of police training is one of the measures to improve the police training system in India. It is suggested that skeleton supervisory and support staff should work on permanent and regular basis. Competent, suitable and willing trainers with regard to various training areas could be called on training need basis on contractual, honorarium or outsource basis

# Training Curriculum and Syllabus

291. Police training curriculum, syllabus, course design and course content are the basic inputs to provide initiative, action, dynamism, goal orientation and success to any training activity. This is yet another area of police training which suffers with indifference and neglect. There is no gainsaying the fact that revision of curriculum, syllabus and courses design should be made from time to time because in the absence of such a revision these documents and training inputs become outdated, defunct and irrelevant.

291.1 A high power committee should be constituted to look after this important area of policing training. The Addl DG training should head the committee. The in charges of various training schools and representative of various police wings along with training experts, sociologists and representative from other important segments of the society should also be made members of this committee. The committee should meet at reasonable regular intervals to decide as to what is to be added and what is to be deleted from the concerned training courses in the light of contemporary and future police and community needs. An overall revision of each curriculum and syllabus should be done once in three years on the basis of comprehensive TNA.

# The Training Methodology

292. The training methodology has a significant role to play in the overall learning and training process. If the methodology is effective and interesting the trainees are natural to learn easily and quickly, and the impact of the learning would also sustain for a long period. On the contrary, if the teaching and training methodology is dull, dry and insipid, it will generate monotony, indifference and disinterest in the participants and the training efforts would consequently fail to achieve the requisite results.

292.1 The Gore Committee has shown a great concerned for the poor and inadequate training methodology prevalent in the various training schools. The situation since the findings of the Gore Committee has improved but still there is a great scope for further improvement. The traditional and routine lecture method has to be replaced by modern training techniques and methods. Audio visual aids, multimedia use and computer teaching and learning should become an integral part of police training system. Each training school should have the requisite aids and equipment to make the police training methodology effective, dynamic and vibrant.

# Feedback and Follow up Methods

293. A training process has to maintain a continuous loop between the input and output of the training activities. The trainer should know what the trainee has learnt and what are the loose ends required to be tightened. He should therefore have continuous reporting on the learning process and status of the trainee. This method of reporting is known as feedback. This feedback can be obtained on the basis of various intermittent, terminal and term-end examinations and tests. On the basis of this feedback the trainer can initiate further follow up action for improvement. The feedback and follow up methods should become an integral part of every training system. The present police training system suffers with the lack of requisite feedback up and follows up system. At present, the trainees are examined at the close of their training course, and they are sent to field training without the requisite corrections. It is therefore necessary that quick and easy testing methods to assess the impact of learning be introduced on fortnightly, monthly, quarterly and annual basis and the corresponding corrective measures be also introduced to bring about the required improvement before the trainees are sent for field training.

# Police Research

294. Research and Analysis are two important parameters for updating and bringing about dynamism and element of modernity in any organization. One of the mentionable ailments of the police organization is that these two functional and operational parameters of efficiency and competence are conspicuous by their absence. Most of the police organizations in the country do not have Research and Analysis Wings, and wherever they exist, they are only in the namesake.

294.1 In order to establish a continuous chain of feedback and follow up for detecting the police ailments and evolving solutions to remove them, each State police organization should have a Research and Analysis Wing as an integral part of the Police Training Directorate. Likewise each training school should have a Research Cell.

Research and Analysis Wing and the Research Cell should be adequately staffed and funded to carry out small, medium and mega police research projects. These research units should have tie up with the academic institutions, universities and colleges for research collaboration and supporting the research activities of one another in mutuality.

294.2 The Research and Analysis Wing and the various Research Cells should maintain close contact with the BPR&D and seek their guidance and support in carrying out their various research activities. Help, assistance, cooperation and guidance from NPA, Hydarabad and other research based and research oriented Organisations should also be obtained by these research units for furthering their objectives.

294.3 These research units should handle and analyze various problems concerning the respective State police organizations. They should endeavor to stimulate ideas, indicate new projects, study new factors, which have bearing on the overall policing and should also act as a clearing house of information based on the results of various research activities undertaken by them and the other research units.

294.4 These research units should collect information of interest to police and analyze that for dissemination of conclusions for bringing about improvement in the various spheres of police working.

294.5 All the research units should be properly equipped and should be furnished with the requisite academic, administrative, financial and research facilities to make them effective, functional, meaningful and goal oriented.

# Chapter 17

# Crime Investigation Department (CB & SB)

# Introduction

295. Crime Investigation Department (CID) is an apex unit of any police organization. This works as an integral part of the police headquarters. CID, over a period of time, has come to be recognized as CID (Crime Branch) and CID (Special Branch). In the earlier days, when the workload and the nature of police duties were not so multifarious, both these branches used to be part of the same department. In due course of time, when the workload with relation to intelligence collection and crime investigation increased, both these branches were separated and, today, in almost all States both these branches function as two separate and independent units of the respective State police organizations, and are called as Crime Branch and Special Branch. The Crime Branch is primarily and chiefly concerned with matters pertaining to crimes, investigations and collection of criminal intelligence, whereas, the Special Branch is primarily and chiefly concerned with collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence on and about various political, communal, terrorist, labour activities and with relation to various law and order issues like agitations, strikes, demonstrations etc.

# A. CID (Crime Branch)

# A Specialized Unit

297. CID, CB, is headed by an officer of the rank of Addl. DGP, who is assisted by a number of officers of the rank of IGP, DIGP and SP. The Crime Branch is a specialized or even super specialized unit, which tackles the various crime related issues at micro level and, therefore, is structured into various branches, squads and cells. Each Branch and Cell deals with separate issues in a specific way. A standard Crime Branch normally has the following branches and the following cells, which deal with the specific matter independently and in a specialized manner.

# Functions of CID (CB)

301. CID CB has the following functions to perform:

1. Collection, collation and dissemination of criminal intelligence, statistics and data.   
2. Investigation of important cases having inter-state ramifications and coordination with CBI and other sister agencies.   
3. Investigation of specialized cases relating to economic offences, counterfeit currency, terrorism, narcotics, smuggling, etc. and cases relating to custodial deaths.   
4. Investigation of sensational/heinous offences and other cases, as assigned by the state government.

9. Criminal Intelligence gazettes.   
10. Handling matters related with crisis management.   
11. Publicity of good work done and achievements of the police.

# Field Formations

302. CID Crime Branch has field offices, which are situated at the divisional/zone/Division/Zone headquarters. These offices handle investigations transferred to them by the government and the competent authority. CID Crime Branch also has a police station where cases can be registered directly.

302.1 CID Crime Branch is a specialized unit of the police department, and, therefore, it should be well equipped in terms of various investigation aids, equipment and other requisite support facilities to aid and assist its own units as well as the field units of the police department as a whole.

# B. CID (Special Branch)

303. CID Special Branch, popularly known as the State Special Branch or Intelligence Branch is an integral part of the Police Headquarter. SSB is primarily responsible for collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence on various aspects, issues and subjects. Collection of intelligence on various subjects is done through the district police and through its own units and agencies. For this purpose a special unit is established in the office of each district SP. This unit is known as the District Special Branch (DSB). The personnel posted in the DSB, under the overall supervision of an Inspector, are assigned specific subjects on which they are required to collect intelligence. The intelligence so collected is received at the SSB headquarters where on the basis of the nature, contents and the trends of the information a critical scrutiny is done, and thereafter intelligence appraisal is sent to the State Government. Likewise, the police field formations and field formations of the SSB are also advised to take suitable action, with regard to various issues on the basis of the intelligence appraisal report.

303.1 SSB prepares periodical report on matters falling within its purview and forward copies to those specified. It makes secret enquiries into sensitive matters or those affecting national interests. It also helps in the investigation of those crimes, which have a political purpose or motive and in which political suspects are involved. It communicates to military officers, important information concerning the armed forces as and when available.

303.2 The central role of the Special Branch is to collect intelligence. The charter of the Special Branch does not envisage a focus on routine crime, but given the nexus of organized crime with terrorism, intelligence on organized crime is gradually becoming part of the work of the Special Branch. Extremism and terrorism, which are special types of crime, have always been in the charter of the Special Branch.

303.3 The intelligence provided by the Special Branch can be used to prevent crime, and also to aid detection in crimes that have already taken place. The Special Branch should gradually build up competence in electronic eavesdropping, which is exceptionally useful in aiding recoveries.

303.4 With the emergence of Jehadi Islam, organised criminal mafia, left wing extremists groups, communal situation and activities of anti-national and anti-social groups, the role of special branch has increased. Efforts should be made to strengthen Special Branch so that it can provide precise, sharp and swift intelligence that can act as a force-multiplier. Such intelligence can minimize chance and randomness in police efforts, and pinpoint operational endeavour to made it work like a guided missile. It can also help apprehend imminent and nascent problems before they become too big. A strong intelligence apparatus can therefore, save time, energy, manpower, other resources, and casualties, more than the costs. Certainly, in the special and extraordinary circumstances, Special Branch has important role to play in the administration of Criminal Justice.

# Functions of SSB

304. Following functions are assigned to the State Special Branch. a) Collection, collation and dissemination of intelligence

b) Border security and border intelligence   
c) VIP security   
d) Internal security   
e) Training of SSB personal   
f) Coordination with various intelligence and security units   
g) Matters relating to foreigners and passports   
h) Maintenance of various records pertaining to security and intelligence matters.

# Structure of SSB

305. SSB, primarily is a centralized unit of the State police organization. The apex level structure of SsB is an integral part of the police headquarters. An officer of the rank of Addl. DGP heads the SSB, who is assisted by a number of officers of the rank of IG, DIG, SP, Addl. SP, DSP, Subordinate police officers along with the requisite ministerial and other support staff. SSB for discharging its various functions is divided into various wings like operations wing, intelligence wing, security and counter intelligence wing and technical wing etc. These wings in turn are divided into various sections and branches. Some of the important branches and sections of the SSB are following:

Extremist/Naxal Section   
Religious/Communal Section   
Political Section   
Labour Section   
Tribal Section   
Foreign Section   
Security Section   
Services and Press Section   
Establishment Section   
DSI Section   
NGO Section   
Accounts Section   
Reserve Office   
Index Section   
Control Room   
Training Section   
Confidential Section- X Section   
Special Enquiry Section   
Political Section- Parties, Students/Teacher's Fronts, Elections   
Left Wing Extremism Section-Activities/Documentation

305.1 SSB is a specialized wing of police organization and the performance and execution of its various functions and duties require that the personnel posted in this wing should be specially trained. Most SSBs, therefore, maintain their own police training schools for organizing basic, foundational, initial, promotion, refresher, reorientation and specialized courses of various nature and kind for its personnel. The SSB officers are nominated for undertaking specialized training courses to other training schools also.

305.2 State of the art surveillance and security equipments like the GSM/CDMA monitors, powerful electronic bugs, digitized 3-D map of the area, electronic circuit detectors and jammers, frequency jammers, low radiation human scanners and grounds penetration radars must be made available to Special Branch so that it could work effectively.

# Chapter 18

# Armed Police

# Introduction

306. One remarkable feature of the post-independence period is that there has been a vast expansion of the armed police battalions at the Centre as well as in States. After independence, law and order problems assumed alarming proportions and the normal police forces were unable to cope with them. To meet this situation, new-armed police battalions have been raised in almost all states to support the executive force in the districts and their number has been gradually increasing. Armed police battalions are called by different names in various states such as Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) in Uttar Pradesh, Special Armed Force (SAF) in Madhya Pradesh, Military Police (BMP) in Bihar, Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) in Rajasthan etc., etc.

# Classification

307. Armed Police, Armed Battalions and Armed Reserves are created at the Central and State levels. At the Central level these units are called as India Reserve Battalions. Central Police Organisations (CPOs) like BSF, CRPF, ITBP, etc. are also used as armed reserves, when they are allotted to the States for some specific purpose and for the specified period. Every State creates armed reserves and armed battalions as per its needs, necessities and conditions. This force is used, utilized and deployed as per the instructions of the DGP or any other officer authorized by him. Most of the States create district reserves for the maintenance of law and order and regulatory duties on the basis of prescribed norms and standards in the matter.

# Organisation of the Battalions

308. The organization of armed battalions is broadly based on the lines of an infantry battalion of army though their armament is limited. A Commandant (CO) of the rank of Superintendent of Police heads each battalion. A battalion has between 4 to 6 companies, each of 100 to 120 men. A company generally consists of 3 platoons. Each platoon consists of 3 sections. In some battalions, there are one or more Assistant Commandants of the rank of junior Superintendent of Police under the Commandant. In this respect, the system differs from state to state. An officer of the rank of DSP or Inspector of Police commands a company. Platoon Commander is of the rank of SI/ASI of Police. A Head Constable (HC) commands a section. Some of the reserved battalions have special units like commandos, Rapid Action Force (RAF), Disaster Management Group etc., etc.

# Duties of the Battalions

309. The battalions are in nature of reserve at the disposal of the Director General of Police, who can direct them into action either on a requisition of the zonal IG or DIG of the Division/Zone or on his own appreciation of a particular situation. They help the district police when the resources of district police are found inadequate to deal with difficult situations. They can be called out to deal with anti-dacoity operations, serious civil commotions, crowd control (at the time of visits of VIPs, large fairs or festivals) and any other law and order situation. They also provide guards and escorts. They can be deputed for duty ex-state on orders of the state government.

# Functions of Reserved Force

310. Some of the functions of the Reserved Force and Armed Police are following:

1. Supplement the local strength where it is not adequate to deal with law and order   
disturbances.   
2. Provide specially trained personnel to deal with terrorist and other organized gangs.   
3.  Provide security to authorized persons or places.   
4. Guard vital installations, arms and ammunition and other important places.   
5. Escort the prisoners.   
6. Participate in ceremonial parades and guards on honour.   
7. Help in rescue operations in the event of natural calamities and other disasters.   
8. To man armed outposts and conduct armed patrolling where called for.   
9. To provide outdoor training for the personnel of the district and Home Guards   
10. To provide striking forces or mobile squads for special bandobusts including   
elections.   
11. Management of arms and ammunition in the district   
12. Maintenance of motor transport of the district

# Movement of the Reserve Police

311. The SsP in the districts and the CsP in the Cities shall have powers to deploy the Reserve anywhere in their jurisdiction for any of stated purpose for deployment and utilization of reserved armed force. In case of emergency the SP or CP may apply through Zonal IG/DIGP to the DGP for reinforcements. The Zonal IG/DIGP, Addl. DGP L&O and DGP should be kept informed by radio/fax of the mobilization and demobilization of the Reserve whether for emergency or for annual training. The deployment for the purpose of riots and serious disturbances shall not exceed one week and shall be withdrawn thereafter. The deployment for festivals shall be limited to the duration of the festival. In all other cases rotation should be provided with intervals for rest.

# Ordinary duties of the Reserve Police

312. The duties to be performed by each Reserve will be classified as "fixed", "special" and "general" duties. "Fixed" duties are those where the personnel performing those duties cannot be withdrawn in times of emergency, e.g., armoury and motor transport staff. Personnel for "fixed" duties will be provided from the headquarters company. "General" duties consist of guards, escorts and other miscellaneous duties. The personnel for "general" duties are provided from the active companies. The company or platoons employed at any given time on general duties are called Duty Company or platoons. The duty platoons will be employed as such for a month at a time in rotation, the others being mobilized and exclusively engaged in training when not called out for any definite or emergent duty.

312.1 Emergency strength as laid down for each Reserve Police must always be available and should be in readiness for immediate action. The emergency strength once fixed shall not be changed without the prior sanction of the Director General of Police in writing. The emergency strength shall be deputed in complete sub-formations, i.e., platoons, sections or half sections, as the situation requires. The purpose and duties to be performed should be specifically spelt, out briefed and understood by each person on each occasion.

# Utilization and Briefing of the Reserve Contingents

313. The Reserve Police shall normally be deputed to assist the local police to meet the exingencies for bandobust, to preserving order at festivals, large public assemblies and when disturbance to peace is anticipated. The deployment of force for this purpose is fully at the discretion of the SP, on the assessment of the situation.

313.1 Whenever such reserve is deputed, a thorough briefing should be done by the in charge of the contingent, i.e. section/Platoon Commander concerned with respect to their specific duties, topography, discretion of the task, reporting mechanism likely difficulties to be encountered and the way to over come them. However, the DSP of the reserve police is responsible for the performance of the force.

# Off duty and relief

314. All Head Constables and Constables in the Reserve should have a clear day off every week. Ordinarily, the whole Reserve, except those employed on such duties as stand-to, motor transport and guards, should have their "off duty" on Sunday. The stand-to motor transport men who are on duty on a Sunday should be given "off duty" the next Thursday. Each Company Commander should display such a list of Head Constables and Constables.

314.1 The personnel of mobilized platoon or platoons will have Sundays free, but they shall not leave their places without permission. Whenever permission is given the platoon Commander shall see that $50 \%$ of the forces are available on Sundays. All those on fixed shall attend morning parades at the Headquarters on Mondays and Fridays. Those who are on off duty should attend the Roll call and failure to do so without valid reason will entail disciplinary action. Normally, it must be seen that policemen avail their weekly holiday undisturbed but they can be deprived only in exceptional circumstances and unavoidable circumstances.

# Officers of Reserve Police

315. An officer of the rank of SP/Addl.SP, who is designated as the Commandant, commands an armed battalion or the reserved battalion. The Commandant is assisted by various Gazetted and non-Gazetted officers. The Gos are designated as Deputy Commanded, Assistant Commanded, Adjutant, and Quarter Master etc. The Subordinate and non-Gazetted officers are designated as RIs, RSIs, Head Constables and Constables, who perform various functions in different branches and sections of the battalion.

315.1 The Reserved Inspector is an important rank in the organisation set up of any armed battalion. There are more than one RI in a battalion, who work as overall in charge of the various sections and branches of the concerned battalion. The status of Reserve Inspector is equivalent to that of an Inspector of the civil police. The Reserve Inspector in charge of active Company shall check the platoon-wise duty rosters of his company daily and on that basis prepare the daily morning statement and submit it to the concerned Addl.SP through the DSP recording his own arrival and departure at Company Headquarters. He shall personally maintain all records of the Company. He shall hand over his sealed duplicate keys to the Reserve Sub-Inspector when he leaves headquarters. He shall assign, by specific written orders every week, for the checking of all Reserve Police guards of his Company. A consolidated statement of deployment shall be submitted daily to the SP/ Commandant.

315.2 Reserve Inspector-Operations will be in charge of Police Control Room, if any, and will be responsible for dispatch and receipt of Reserve Police Contingents and would depute personnel for guards, escorts, bandobust duties, inspection of personnel being deputed on duty and on their return, checking arms and equipment and other material and stores issued to them or brought by them, and making entries accordingly in the General Diary. He would also ensure safe custody of Railway and bus warrants books, preparation of day-to-day schedule of duty and deployment, custody of all working keys and of all the duplicate keys in sealed covers. He should be available at Headquarters and not leave his residence without prior permission of the DSP. In addition to the above two important RIs in a battalion, there are other RIs, who look after important branches like motor transport, training, welfare etc. These RIs are assisted by requisite number of RSIs, HCs and Constables in the discharge of their various functions. The Inspectors, Sub-Inspectors and HCs when they work in the active and operational contingents, they are called as Company Commanders (CCs), Platoon Commanders (PCs) and Section Commanders respectively.

# District Reserve Police

316. District Reserve Police is organised on the administrative pattern of a Battalion. The City or State Reserve Police may have more than one Battalion. The District Reserve Police shall have 4 to 8 companies. Ordinarily there shall be three platoons in an active company and three sections in a platoon. A section consists of 2 HCs and $1 2 \mathrm { P C s }$

316.1 Functionally the Reserve shall consist of General, Special operations, Security and Logistics groups. An officer of the rank of DSP/Addl. SP shall assist the SP and be in charge of District Reserve Police. A Deputy Superintendent of Police/RI shall be in charge of 2 or more Companies or in charge of Administration. Reserve Inspector (RI)/RSI will be the Company Commander. A platoon shall be commanded by a Reserve Sub-Inspector (RSI)/ARSI assisted by HCs. Each section will function under the command of the seniormost Head Constable of that section designated as Section Commander.

# Records in the District Reserve Police

317. District Reserve Police will maintain following records and registers:

i. Long Leave Register ii. Casual Leave Register iii. Duty Roster iv. Family Quarters Register v. Transfer Seniority List vi. Seniority lists (also showing eligibility to promotion) vii. Counseling Orderly Room viii. Pay Disbursement Register

# Scale, Care, Maintenance and Inspection of Arms and Ammunition

318. The BPR&D has worked out scale of arms for various units of police department. The Armed and District Reserve should maintain weapons, arms and ammunitions according to that scale.

318.1 All designated Officers of the Units to which arms and ammunition have been issued shall maintain histories of the firearms and weapons supplied to them in the prescribed Form. The Quarter master/RI shall also maintain a similar register for all weapons on the charge of the district/city. He shall scrutinize this register and ensure that each firearm is rebrowned in due time and are produced for AIA's inspection in accordance with the orders on the subject.

318.2 During the course of a month, preferably in the first and the last week, the armourer of the Reserve shall inspect the arms. He shall inspect every weapon borne on the strength of each unit. The armourer will attend to only minor repairs at the sub-divisional headquarters. He will make out a list of arms requiring major repairs and the SDPO concerned shall send such arms to the district headquarters, where repairs shall be undertaken at the police armoury. This procedure should strictly be followed to enable the district armourer to test every weapon twice a year.

318.3 During the course of the second week of a month, the armourer shall inspect the arms and automatic weapons of the Reserve police and point out the defects, if any, to the concerned Platoon Commanders. He shall also attend to the half-yearly lubrication of arms.

318.4 When weapons are taken out, the policemen shall dry clean them and before returning them to the armoury, they shall apply oil to all the metallic portions.

327.1 On the approach of a person or persons, the sentry should call out in a sharp tone, "Hello! Who comes there?" (THUM, KAUN ATA HAI?) and simultaneously take up "On guard" (TAN SHASTR) position. When there is reasonable apprehension of an attack from him or when two or more persons approach, the sentry should call out the guard. If the approaching person or persons at once halt and reply satisfactorily, the sentry will say "Raise your hands and advance or advance one at a time (in the case of two or more persons) and be recognized" (PAHCHAN KE LIYE (EK) AGE BARHO). After the persons(s) have been recognized by means of passes or otherwise," the sentry or the Guards Officer will say, "pass, all is well" (CHALO, SAB THEEK HAI). After the person or persons have passed, the sentry will slope arms and the guard, if turned out, will be dismissed to the guardroom.

327.2 If a person fails to halt and reply when challenged, the sentry should turn out the guard and the Guard Officer will then institute enquiries and take such action as is required to deal with the situation. Fire may be opened only in self-defence when there is an apprehension of being over-powered or when there is a reasonable belief that the intruder is armed with firearm or explosives or when there is an imminent danger of the property under guard being destroyed or sabotaged. Otherwise if a person cannot satisfactorily explain his presence there, he should be detained in the guard room and the SHO informed at once by telephone or other quickest means available followed by a report with a copy, in the case of a Reserve or Special Police guard, to the concerned Company Commander.

Neglect of guard duty will be met with severe punishment. Absence from, or sleeping while on sentry duty will normally entail dismissal from the service. In case where the responsibility for any loss of or damage to the property guarded by an armed guard cannot be fixed on any particular member or members of the guard, then the entire guard should be held jointly responsible for the loss or damage.

# Compliments by Guards

328. During the day, s entries will alert the guard to turn out on the approach of any senior officer entitled to compliments. The procedure for paying compliments will be that on the approach of the officer the sentry on duty will turn out the guard. The guard will line up and take up positions.

If an officer, whom guards compliments have been given appears again during the same day, the sentry will present arms. Officers of lower in rank than Gazetted Officers will be given butt salute by the sentry.

# Rules for Particular Guards

A. Sub-Jail Guards

329.3 When prisoners are taken out of the cell for any purpose, names of the prisoners taken out and the purpose for which they are taken out should be entered in the Sentry Relief Book, and the officer receiving the prisoners should acknowledge them in the same book. When prisoners are brought back to the cell, a similar entry should be made.

329.4 When prisoners pass in and out of the Sub-Jail, the guard must stand at such a distance that, should a prisoner try to rush and grapple with them, they may have time to react suitably. The guard shall resist by force all attempts made to break into or out of any part of a prison, and shall aid in the suppression of all violence or opposition to authority on the part of prisoners. In the event of any attempt to break out of the jail or prison, or any other disturbance occurring, the guard shall immediately fall in, load and take all steps to prevent and control it, and the Guard Officer shall at once do his best to communicate with the jailor and his own superior Officers. If, however, prisoners assault the Prison Officer considers that it would be dangerous to delay until the arrival of superior prison officials, he shall rescue the Prison Officer and shall administer loud and clear warning to prisoners that, if they do not immediately surrender and get back to the cells necessary force will be used including opening of fire. This warning shall (if circumstances admit of delay) be repeated twice, and, if it appears to the officer that there is no other means of quelling the disturbance, the Guard Officer shall direct his men to open fire upon the refractory prisoners in self defence when a murderous attack is made upon the guard or on jail officials or other prisoners. Firing shall cease as soon as the prisoners flee back into the ward, cells, or surrender. On the arrival of the Superintendent of the Prison or a superior officer of police, the guard shall act under his orders.

329.5 When prisoners attempt to escape, the guard should prevent the escape by all possible means in their power.

329.6 The guard shall not take any part in the daily discipline of the prison. As per Section 31 and 32 of Prisoners Act 1934, civil prisoners and non-convicted (under trial) prisoners shall be permitted to maintain themselves and to purchase or receive from private sources food, clothing, bedding or other necessities subject to examination by prison officials. But they should not allow such food to be given to co-prisoners. The Guard Officer or senior Constables in charge of the guard shall not hold any communication with a prisoner either by words or signs.

The police shall not interfere in the matter of jail administration. Their duties shall be limited to guarding prisoners and giving assistance in case of refractory behaviour on the part of the prisoners.

# B. Treasury and Sub-Treasury Guards

330. Guards should be provided only for non-banking Treasuries and Sub-Treasuries who handle large amounts of cash. For the security of Stamps and other valuable documents in banking sub-Treasuries, no guard need be provided. Arrangements for their safe custody in specially designed steel safes embedded in walls or floor, electronic security devices and alarm systems will serve the purpose. The Alarm may be connected to nearest Police Station if desired for emergency action by the police.

330.1 At each relief, the Guard Officer shall go round the premises with the sentry on duty and the relieving sentry and examine them thoroughly, noting whether all seals are correct. If there is anything wrong a note shall be made at once in the record and the concerned authorities will be informed immediately.

330.2 The Officer in-charge of a treasury or sub-treasury guard should be present every evening when the treasury is closed any every morning when it is opened. He should examine the seals with the sentry on duty. The private seal of the Treasury or Sub-Treasury Officer will be affixed to the outside of the treasury door in addition to the official seal.

The Officer in-charge of the treasury or sub-treasury guards should also receive the sealed bag containing the keys of the record rooms of the respective treasuries for safe custody and sign in the appropriate column of the register maintained for the purpose.

# C. Police Station Guards

331. Every Police Station should have a guard consisting of three men from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m., even if there are no prisoners in the lock-up or no cash in the cash chest. The guard will be mounted at $7 \ \mathrm { p . m }$ . and the sentries posted at intervals of two hours as in the case of other guards. The guard will be relieved at 7 a.m. in the morning by the Station Writer. So long as the Station Writer is present in the station he will function as Guard Officer. When he goes home, he will hand over charge to the senior-most Constable of the guard, who, besides mounting sentry in his turn, will also act as Guard Officer. The Sub-Inspector and Head Constables should often check the guard.

331.1 There will be a station watch Constable during the daytime from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. The Station Writer and the station watch Constable will be responsible for guarding the Government property in the Station during the daytime. The station watch Constable should be allowed to go for his food. Both the Station Writer and the station watch Constable should not be absent from the Station at the same time. When the Station Writer leaves the station at night, he will hand over charge to the night guard.

331.2 For Police Stations or Police posts located in areas affected by terrorists, guarding should be specially planned depending on the location, the layout and the nature of the building, the area and material to be guarded and the existing threat perception. Where the perception is acute and there is every possibility of attack at any time the arrangements to be made should include bunkers or sand bag protection to sentries, securing of arms and ammunition, illumination, access control through pass system, identity card or code words. In such guards, there should be two sentry posts each covering the safety of the others from attack. Barbed wire fencing as an outer perimeter should also be provided. The guards should be re-enforced either by rooftop guard or a parallel guard armed with sophisticated weapons in areas where there is a threat by extremists. The strength of these guards should be decided by assessment of threat to a particular police station/outpost. It is advisable in such situations that normal police work be transacted in an OP in the village or town near the PS for convenience of public with unarmed Head Constables and Police Constables, with the Police Station itself being heavily guarded against attack by terrorists.

# D. VIP Guards

332. Guards for VIPs have both security and ceremonial aspects. For the police on guard duty, being a uniformed force, it is necessary that due courtesy to the dignitary and ceremony associated with his visit is built into it, but not in such a manner or to the extent that it overshadows or obscures the main objective of security. All ceremonies therefore are to be kept to the barest minimum and done in perfect dignity and decorum while keeping primary motto of security and safety in mind.

332.1 Where ceremonial part is to be given more importance in respect of certain dignitaries or occasions the guard should be separate and formed for the purpose and dispersed soon after. Guard of Honour generally covers this category, which is to be organized for specified dignitaries in the manner prescribed. The guard posted for security purposes should never be converted into some sort of Guard of Honour under any circumstances.

332.2 If a dignitary does not wish to have a guard or escort, it may be withdrawn and the fact intimated to the DGP. Where a regular guard is not contemplated at the camp of a dignitary but the place where he is camping is an out of the way place or if any trouble is apprehended, a guard must necessarily be posted, the strength of which should be decided by the Superintendent of Police depending upon the circumstances.

332.3 Guards for the President of India, Vice President of India and the Prime Minister will be provided as per the provisions of Blue Book and instructions contains in the booklets, "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the person of the President when on tour" and "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the person of the Prime Minister of India when on tour and in travel". The Intelligence department also issues instructions separately. For the Union Home Minister, the instructions issued from time to time by the Addl. DGP Intelligence and Security should be complied with.

# E. Guards for Protected Persons and Vulnerable Buildings

333. Protective arrangements are ordered for various categories of people facing threat to their lives. Normal guard rules may cause hardship to the protectee and his family as also to the guard personnel. However, difficulties are posed in guarding protected persons because the place of residence of protectees may not afford necessary facilities for a guard, the access control or screening visitors may become difficult if the person to be guarded has a small house in a busy area or is easily accessible to public.

333.1 Their difficulties to a great extent may be minimized by increase or decrease in the strength of guards, as needed. Usually 2 plain-clothes security men are also provided to those for whom guards are provided at residence. There should be a close liaison between the two as to the response to any given situation.

333.2 The unit officer providing guard shall be responsible for making necessary arrangements for the accommodation and other facilities for the proper stay of the guard. This includes hiring of accommodation for the guard, if needed. The expenditure for this may be met from unit budget. If necessary, the additional funds shall be provided by the Government. Under no circumstances the purpose of providing the guard for the protectee shall be compromised.

333.3 Where the protection guards are to protect the buildings, the premises should have a perimeter wall and/or effective barbed wire fencing sufficiently high with a over-hang of at least one metre. In terrorist-affected or other more vulnerable areas barbed wire at the base of the fencing or wall outside should also be provided. All approaches should be well lighted and whenever necessary searchlights should be provided. Only one entrance should be available and a strong gate electrically controlled, wherever feasible, should be fixed.

333.4 A minimum of two sentry posts and more, where necessary should be provided support sentry for each sentry post should be provided both during day and night. The sentry post should be well protected, which should afford a good view of the area covered by the post. The guard should be armed with SLR or AK 47 rifles with two magazines of 100 rounds of ammunition. The guardroom should be separated from the other area where arrangements for rest, guard weapons and other equipment should be made. Toilet facilities, drinking water and food arrangements should be made by the SHO or Company Commander. Plain clothes or uniformed Constables who are sent out or come in to the protected premises in course of duty when they go out and before entering should have instructions to move about in the surroundings of the area watching for any suspicious person.

333.5 Where residential houses are close-by the area beat men should have a complete picture of occupants and visitors in the normal course of their work. It is important that neighbors are friendly and cooperate with police. The police would ensure this, only if they are friendly and do not interfere with their privacy and normal work.

333.6 The nature of threat, the source of threat, the weapons likely to be used, the possible methods of entry specific to each place should all be entered in the Guard standing orders.

# F. Guards for Other Departments

334. The watch and ward duty of an organization including government departments should be left to them as they may requisition the services of SPF, CISF, RPF or privately owned security agencies on payment or may have their own security guards. The bank, treasury, examination papers, protection of railway property, stamps, archives, museums, archaeological sites, cash of government departments are some of the examples covered in this category. The main category of guards with which police is directly connected are those with internal security implications as well as protection of life of persons who face a specific threat by virtue of office they hold or held or being targets of terrorist or organized crime groups. When other departments make applications for guards for emergency purposes, the Superintendent of Police or DCP should use his discretion for providing them.

# G. Guard of Honour

335. The Guard of Honour will depend on the status of the personage for whom it is mounted. It will consist of 1 Gazetted Police Officer, 2 Junior Police Officers, 2 RSIs or ARSIs and $1 4 8 \ \mathrm { m e n }$ , whenever mounted for the President of India, the Head of a foreign State or Governor-General of a Commonwealth Country.

335.1 Such types of guards need not follow the Guard rules regarding weapons, etc. but should effectively achieve the objective of protection by more professional and informal methods. Long Rifles for guards of this nature should be avoided. Instructions regarding the layout of the Guard of Honour, salute, inspection and other details are given in the Drill Manual. Every unit must frequently practice the drill for the presentation of the Guard of Honour and be able to present a Guard of Honour at a short notice.

# Guard Record

336. Each guard will maintain:

A. Sentry Relief Book B. Guard Duty Roster/Register

# A. Sentry Relief Book

337. All guards shall maintain a Sentry Relief Book. The Sentry Relief Book maintained at the guard shall be written up every time a sentry is changed and signed by the Guard Officer and the relieving sentry. In this the Guard Officer shall enter the absence of, or neglect of duty by any member of the guard, the escape of any prisoner, the fact of treasury seals being received and correctly handed over, and the letting out of prisoners from the cells for any purpose their return and all other details connected with the duty. Officers, who check the guard, will record their visits and particulars. Noticed by them in the "Sentry Relief Book".

# B. Guard Duty Roster/Register

338. The Guard Officer shall send the guard duty roster every month to the Station House Officer, or the Reserve Inspector, if the guard is posted from the Armed Reserve, or the Company Commander, if it is posted from a Special Police Battalion.

# Escorts

339. In common parlance the word escort means accompanying a person, property and thing for carrying him/it to a destination by providing adequate security and protection. In policing contexts the concept of Escorts means that a duly armed contingent is provided for the safe passage and carriage of persons, properties, items and things.

# Classification

340. Requisitions are received for providing Escorts by the police department for various reasons by different departments and organizations. However, looking to the general practice of use of Escorts, the Police Escorts can be classified into the following categories:

A. Escorts for the prisoners and criminals   
B. Escorts for carrying cash, treasuries and other valuables   
C. VIP Escorts   
D. Miscellaneous Escorts

# Modes of Travel

341. The Police Escorts may adopt any of the modes of travel as per the need, necessity and urgency pertaining to the subject matter in question. Rail, road, air or sea travel modes can be resorted to for Escort purposes. The Escort in- charge and the Escort party should keep in mind the advantages, disadvantages, difficulties entailed in the specifically selected mode of travel and should exercise all care and precaution to avert and prevent happening of any untoward incident and should ensure that under all circumstances safe passage up to the destination is available. Whenever travel by road is undertaken it should be ensure that journeys are completed before the dusk. It should also be ensure that communication facilities are available. If there is need for break in the journey, it should be ensure that night stay arrangements are adequately made and there is sufficient provisions for lock up etc. if journey is required to be made by train, reserved accommodation should be arranged in advance. The strength of the Escort party should be carefully fixed in the light of journey time and number of prisoners and sensitivity of the item, thing or person being escorted.

# Strength and Composition of Escort Party

342. While actual strength and composition of the escort party would have to be determined in each case depending upon various relevant considerations, the escort party for terrorists and dangerous criminals should invariably be headed by an officer not below the rank of an Inspector. In appropriate cases, a senior officer including a Dy. SP or an ACP may be deployed. For every such prisoner there shall be at least two constables/guards having direct custody of the prisoner, exclusive of armed guards of the escort party. The minimum strength of the escort party in no case shall be less than 1 SI, 1HC, and 3 Constables per prisoner. At least $7 5 \%$ of the escort party shall be armed, including automatic arms, (LMGs/Sten guns) SLRs/ Rifles as may be appropriate. The composition and strength of the escort party shall be so determined (depending on travel time, mode of travel, number of prisoners, etc.) so that even if two or three members are absent at any given time for answering calls of nature, other duties, etc., the extent and quantum of vigilance is not diluted. The minimum strength of the police guard should be as follows:

i. For a single prisoner, two Constables   
ii. For two prisoners, two Constables   
iii. For more than two and not more than four prisoners, two Constables,   
iv. For more than four and not more than six prisoners, one Head Constable and three Constables   
v. For more than six and not more than ten prisoners, one Head Constable and four Constables

342.1 In case of prisoners, the considerations for deciding the strength of the Escort party could be the number and class of prisoners, whether they are dangerous, ordinary, under trial, female or juvenile. Provisions should be made for the relief of Escort party and while deciding the strength of the Escort contingent, the factors like hostile or support demonstrations en route or at place of stay and the date and probable hour of arrival at the destination should be given due consideration. In case of deciding the strength of treasury Escorts, factors like the value of the treasury, its nature whether in gold, silver, copper nickel or currency notes, the number of wagons, number of boxes, escort relief, journey period and probable date of arrival should be given adequate consideration.

# Specific Escorts: Instructions and Precautions

# A. Escorts for Prisoners and Criminals

343. The provisions of The Prisoners (Attendance in Courts) Act, 1955 are relevant in the contexts of these escorts. Accordingly the duty of escorting under trails prisoners from jails and lock-ups to courts for trail devolves on the police. The prison officer should give timely intimation to the police of the dates and the number of prisoners to be escorted to allow of the necessary arrangements being made.

343.1 While yardsticks regarding the strength of police escort parties/guards for escorting prisoners have been prescribed in various orders of the police manual, the arrangements need to be reviewed and strengthened in the context of escorting terrorists, extremists, dangerous criminals and other high security/escape risk prisoners. Prisoners are required to be escorted in various types of situations including escorting from prisoners to courts and hospitals vice versa and also from one prison to courts/prisons both within and outside the State. While in each case, the strength and composition of the escort party would require to be fixed after considering various relevant factors including number of prisoners, their antecedents, mode of travel and duration of journey, etc. the under mentioned points may be kept in mind.

343.2 The police party should be thoroughly briefed by the jail authorities and senior police officials with regard to antecedents of prisoners, their habits, past modus operandi and whether they are high security/escape risks before handing them over. Through physical search of prisoners should be conducted by both jail staff and escort party before taking them over. They should not be allowed to carry any articles, which can be used for offensive/escape purposes.

343.3 Only vehicles in good condition should be used for escorting terrorists and dangerous criminals. Invariably two vehicles should be deployed with one acting as an escort vehicle in which a wireless set must be installed to report, at prescribed intervals if necessary the location and position of the party. In case of long distance travel there should be a third vehicle with armed guard for better guarding and acting as standby in case of any break down.

343.4 Handcuffs, locks, chains, etc. should be checked up thoroughly for being in good order. The party should invariably carry one long chain, rope and two steel rings with locks per prisoner. The party should be equipped with a spare set of handcuffs, powerful batteries/torches and light pistols. In exceptional cases leg irons, fetters could also be used as per relevant provisions of the jail/police manuals. However, in such cases detailed justifications and reasons should be recorded in writing in view of the Supreme Court Judgment and wherever necessary prior permission of Courts obtained.

343.5 The Guard/Constable in immediate custody of the prisoners(s) should be unarmed to obviate the chance of getting overpowered and losing his weapon. However, other armed guards at the hand reach of the prisoner can cover the prisoner adequately. During transit, glass bottles for water should be avoided and only plastic bottles should be permitted. Items of equipments like chains/ropes/torches should be so placed that the prisoners have no ready access to them.

343.6 The guards should so position themselves and be vigilant as to obviate/minimize possibility of chilly powder or other material being thrown in eyes/face as has been reported in several cases, particularly in congested areas. The police escort party should be cautioned to prevent any contact, exchange of articles or conversation with all (including friends and relatives) in transit and also in court premises. They should be warned against attempts by prisoners to gain their confidence resulting in laxity in custody and also against accepting and food, drinks, or hospitality while escorting prisoners.

343.7 As far as possible, feeding of both prisoners and the escort party should be completed before commencement of the journey. Whenever food on route becomes necessary the convoy should be stopped as far as possible at the police station/police lock-up premises and not in congested areas/bazaars. Food before being consumed by the prisoners shall be tasted/checked.

343.8 For answering calls of nature etc. police stations/police lock-ups en route should be used. However, if it becomes necessary to stop en route, the leader of the escort party should select the spot. Where necessary, prisoners should be tied with long chain and only handcuff released. Under all circumstances, it has to be ensured that the prisoner(s) is always in close proximity and under the direct gaze of the guards at all times.

343.9 Jail doctors should be instructed to recommend outside treatment only in the most deserving/critical cases. As far as possible separate and secure accommodation in the hospitals outside jail premises should be arranged for the prisoner and for the guards in the immediate vicinity.

343.10 When a prisoner is to be escorted by rail, in no circumstances he will be taken to the railway station more than three-quarters of an hour before the departure of the train by which he is to travel. Prisoners in transit by rail should be detained in railway police stations, provided they have lock-ups. Otherwise, they should be taken for safe custody to the nearest local police station, provided there is such a station within two miles from the railway station. If there is no lock-up in the railway police station and if there is no local police station within two miles, prisoners should be kept in the railway police station and should be guarded, reinforcements obtained if necessary, from the railway police station.

343.11 In courts where terrorists/dangerous criminals are frequently required to be produced, arrangements for earmarking a room or some other place for holding them in custody pending court proceedings should be arranged. In case of high escape risk prisoners, permission of the court to keep the prisoners in hand-cuffs, if necessary, fetters should be obtained and they be requested to take up their cases on priority to reduce waiting time. Special care should be taken while allowing prisoners to use toilet facilities. Conversation/communication, etc. with outsiders in court premises (which are generally crowded) should not be permitted.

343.12 Long distance journeys should invariably be performed by special jail vans, which ideally would provide prison condition. They should have separate compartments divided by iron grills and wire mesh for prisoners with seats with self locking belts and guards and separate section for armed escort. For long distances, provisions for toilets/urinals should if possible be made within the vehicles by having a small area/curtained portion-containing commodes/urine (plastic) bottles.

343.13 The escort accompanying prisoners conveyed by police bus or prison van may unfix bayonets before embussing; but they shall always fix bayonets when superintending prisoners entering or leaving the bus or van. The police bus or van shall be brought as close as possible to the point where prisoners are to be taken out from their place of confinement. For this purpose, the driver shall comply to the best of his ability with the instructions of the escort officer regardless of the rank. If the prisoners are escorted in a public bus, the escort will so dispose itself as always to be between the prisoners and any door and between the prisoners and any member of the public. When parties escorting prisoners by road are required to halt for the night en route, halting places shall be selected, if possible where lock-ups are available.

343.14 Whenever a prisoner is sent for examination to, or has to halt at night en route at, a station where there is a central or district jail, he should be confined therein. Where there is no central or district jail he should confined in the subsidiary jail, and where there is no subsidiary jail, he should be confined in the police lock-up. If the escort is unable to reach a Central, District or Subsidiary jail before sunset, the police should make necessary arrangements for the safe custody of the prisoner.

343.15 If the prisoner is taken to a Central, District or Subsidiary jail, the jail or police establishment guarding it will be responsible for the custody of the prisoner. Whenever the escort desires to proceed the prisoner will be handed over for that purpose, provided that no prisoner escort desires to proceed the prisoner will be handed over for that purpose, provided that no prisoner escorted under these rules will be admitted into a jail after sunset, nor handed over to the escort before the sunrise.

343.16 If the prisoner is taken to a police lock-up, in which there are no other prisoners, the police in charge of the lock-up will permit the prisoner escorted under these rules to occupy a ward in the lock-up, the key of which will be handed over to the escort and the prisoners, the prisoner will be entirely under the charge of the escort with its prisoner, the key of ward occupied will b e returned to the police in charge of the lock-up. In the event of a police lockup being occupied by other prisoners, the prisoner will be confined with them, the police in charge of the lock-up being then responsible for his safe custody. The duty of supplying the prisoner with food and of watching him cook and eat will rest with the police escorting him.

343.17 While escorting prisoners to and from courts or while waiting outside the courts, no one should be allowed to speak to or to approach any prisoner. When a convict is removed to give evidence in a court situated at a place other than that where he is undergoing his sentences, he should be delivered for custody until such time as his attendance in court is required, to a prison, or in the absence of a prison into a lock-up at the place where the court is situated. When his attendance is no longer required, he should be taken to the nearest district or central prison.

343.18 Under/trial prisoners should not be handcuffed unless there is a reasonable expectation either from the heinous nature of the crimes with which he is charged or from his character or behaviour that such person will use violence or will attempt to escape or that an attempt will be made to rescue him.

# Arms of Escort of Prisoners

344. On escort duty with prisoners, the Head Constable or Head Constables in the escort should not carry arms. Of the Constables forming the escort, not more than half the number will carry arms. In a party of one Head Constable and three Constables, one Constable should have a rifle; in a party of one Head Constable and six Constables, three Constables should have rifles. No Head Constable or Constables should carry any side arms on such escort duty. Instead of side arms, batons may be provided, if necessary. Each Constable armed with a rifle will carry 10 rounds of ball ammunition in his pouch. In such parties, the Head Constable will arrange that there is only one-armed Constable who will walk in front of the party. When there are several armed Constables, there should be one in front and the others divided on either side of the prisoners. It will be the duty of the Head Constable-in-charge to keep in his possession all warrants or correspondence relating to the prisoners. It will be the duty of the Constables without arms to hold the prisoners' ropes or chains to prevent their escape.

344.1 There orders regarding arms to be carried by escort parties will apply when normal conditions exist. When disturbances occur or are apprehended, the proportion of arms carried shall be increased at the discretion of the officers dispatching the escort party, and in such times the same authority may also vary the amount and nature of the ammunition carried. Escort parties required to half at nights at places in which no secure lock-up exists should be provided with sufficient arms to ensure their safety from attack and permit them to mount the necessary sentries.

344.2 Should an escape be attempted, and prisoners resist the effort of the escort to prevent the escape, escort will be fully justified in using firearms for their own protection or to overcome the prisoners' resistance and, if necessary, for either purpose in shooting or using force on the prisoners. This extreme course should never be resorted to unless in cases of absolute necessity.

# Documents When Prisoners Transferred to Another Jail

345. The following documents relating to each prisoner transferred will be given to the officer-in-charge of the escort to be delivered to the Superintendent of the receiving jail. His original warrant or warrants duly endorsed, a copy of the committing court's judgement if available, the order of any appellate court and any order of government on any petition made by the prisoner, a nominal roll, his history sheet, his remission ticket (if he is under remission system), his medical case (if he is transferred on medical grounds), duplicate and triplicate lists of all private property belonging to the prisoner, list of clothing, bedding and other Government property sent with him, and a certificate regarding his health in the transferring jail and of prisoner's fitness to travel, signed by the medical officer.

# Securing of Prisoners Under Escort

346. When prisoners under escort are handcuffed, they should always be handcuffed in pairs, the left wrist of the one being hand-cuffed to the right wrist of the other. When the number under escort consists of an odd number, as three, five, seven, nine, etc., the odd man should be hand-cuffed to other prisoners. In cases of dangerous or refractory characters special measures should be taken with a view to securing their custody under the order of the Superintendent of Police. While halting, such precautions only should be taken as are absolutely necessary for security. If leg irons are used, leather gaiters must be used for each prisoner to prevent abrasion of the skin. Convict warders and convict overseers need not be handcuffed when under escort from on jail to another.

# Instructions for Using Handcuffs

347. The use of handcuffs not only causes humiliation to the prisoner but also destroys his self-respect and is contrary to the modern notions in the treatment of offenders. Prisoner should not normally be handcuffed, unless he is violent or disorderly or circumstances necessitate such handcuffing. No person arrested by a police officer or remanded to custody by a magistrate on a charge of having committed a bailable offence, shall be hand-cuffed unless for some special reasons it believed hat he is likely to escape.

347.1 A prisoner should not normally be handcuffed unless he is violent and disorderly, or circumstances necessitate such handcuffing. Fetters should not be imposed on any prisoner admitted in a hospital except with the approval of the medical officer and in no case prisoners who are aged and bed ridden in hospital should be hand cuffed or fettered. In no case handcuffs or fetters, should be imposed on women prisoners, juvenile prisoners or civil prisoners.

347.2 No person arrested by a police officer or remanded to custody by a magistrate, on a charge of having committed a bailable offence, shall be handcuffed unless for some special reasons it is believed that he is likely to escape.

347.3 When an accused is in court during the trial he must be held to be in the custody of the court. If the accused is so dangerous that it is necessary to handcuff him, a representation should be made to the court and the court will issue proper instructions in the matter. Accused persons while in courts during trial should not be handcuffed except with the permission of the court.

347.4 Under trial prisoners while being escorted to and from courts, shall not be hand cuffed and chained unless there is a reasonable expectation either from the heinous nature of the crimes with which they are charged or from their character or behaviour that such persons will use violence or will attempt to escape or that an attempt will be made to rescue them. The same principle will be applied to convicts proceeding in public places in police custody. The decision as to whether handcuffs and chains should be used or not will ordinarily lie with the Station House Officer or in his absence, with the officer next below him in seniority.

347.5 Whenever accused, but un-convicted persons are handcuffed, the facts and the reasons for it shall be stated in the Station House Diary. Whenever it is considered necessary to handcuff the accused, but un-convicted prisoners confined in a sub-jail when taken out in the precincts of the sub-jail for food or exercise, the orders of the Superintendent of the sub-jail should be obtained in the prescribed register kept for the purpose by the officer-in-charge of every sub-jail guard. In regard to refractory, violent or dangerous prisoners, the officer-incharge of the sub-jail guard or the senior police officer present may impose handcuffs in cases where the orders of the Superintendent of the sub-jail can not be obtained in time to avoid risk, provided the facts shall be reported to the Superintendent at once.

# Method of Using Handcuffs and Chains

348. In securing a prisoner under escort, the primary issue is that the policeman in charge should be alert. If there be negligence in this respect, no amount or method of tying or handcuffing will prevent a prisoner's escape. If it be necessary to use handcuffs, the key-holes of the handcuffs should be kept uppermost, as in this position it is not easy to open them by striking on some hard substance. Care should also be taken that the handcuffs are not too large; otherwise, prisoner can slip his hand through them. It should also be ensured that the handcuffs are in good working condition.

348.1 When there is only one prisoner, there is the simple device of attaching the handcuffs to the prisoner's right hand and to a Constable's left. Both the prisoner and the Constable can walk in comfort but the prisoner cannot escape. It is sometimes advisable to handcuff a prisoner with his arms behind his back. The prisoner can walk quite comfortably but cannot run fast; and at the same time, he cannot strike the handcuffs on some hard substance to break them open. When travelling by train, a prisoner who is handcuffed behind cannot easily escape as he finds it difficult to jump out and then pick himself up again.

348.2 Leading chains may also be used in addition to handcuffs. The leading chain has a steel ring of a diameter of two inches and a handle. The steel ring should be passed through one of the pairs of handcuffs in an unlocked position and thereupon the handcuff put on the prisoner. Both cuffs should be locked: otherwise the leading chain will slip off.

348.3 The officer-in-charge of the escort should be supplied with two pairs of removable legshackles if available, to be temporarily substituted for handcuffs when convicts are easing themselves on the journey.

348.4 Before taking the convicts, the officer-in-charge of the escort should ensure that all handcuffs and fetters when used are secure and are in good order and that none of the convicts can possibly rid themselves of them without aid. This examination will be repeated whenever the convicts halt or resume their journey. The police should provide the handcuffs and leg-shackles.

# Treatment of Sick Prisoners

349. When the convict becomes seriously ill on the road so as to be unfit for travelling, he should be left at the next station or outpost to be taken as soon as he can be moved to the nearest jail or lock-up, there to be treated by the Medical Officer and a report of the circumstances should be made to the Superintendent of the dispatching jail and the jail to which the convict was travelling. If a convict coupled to another falls sick, he should be from his companion, the latter being coupled to any odd convict, there may be in the party. Should cholera appear on the march either among the convicts or the guard, the party should halt immediately or the officer in command should apply for orders to the nearest Station House Officer?

349.1 In case of death among convicts, the officer-in-charge will report the fact to the nearest Police Station and make arrangements for the due custody of the corpse until the arrival of the Magistrate to hold the inquest. The officer-in-charge of the station, when such death is reported, will be responsible for the due disposal of the body after inquest.

349.2 When an escort is required for a person suffering from an infections disease, the officer providing the escort, will be given full details of the disease and whether the person is badly infected with. The officer providing the escort will then obtain the services of an ambulance for conveying the person to the infectious diseases hospital or to any other destination. In case of smallpox, only those Constables who have recently been vaccinated will be deputed for the escort. In case of other diseases, constables who have been inoculated against that particular disease should be deputed. Where there are no Constables so inoculated, arrangements should at once be made to get the escort party inoculated before they are deputed. On return from duty, the Constable should hand in their uniforms, which should be sent at once for fumigation. The Constables should also be advised to have a bath before mixing themselves with the other Constables.

349.3 Detenues are allowed to use their personal cash property for legitimate purposes during journeys while under police escort. The police escort will be in custody of the personal cash property and should maintain accounts of the expenditure incurred during transit.

# B. Escorts for the Treasury, Cash and Valuables

350. Extreme vigil, vigilance and extraordinary precautions are required to be exercised for the escorts of this type for protecting the treasures from the attacks of criminals and antisocial elements with a view to committing offences like robbery and dacoity.

350.1 When money is remitted within the district in locked boxes, the police escort should give a receipt in terms of sealed boxes. The escort officer should carefully examine the seals and locks and count the boxes. The loaded boxes have to be weighed in the presence of the escort as a precaution.

350.2 The instructions contained in the Treasure Code are for the guidance of officers in charge of cash (treasure) escorts. The escorts are solely and entirely responsible for the safe transit of the cash/treasure boxes and for handling over the boxes in the condition in which they received them. The escort officer shall see the boxes of notes and coins weighed. He shall satisfy himself that each box or chest is properly fastened and secured before he takes charge or it. He should refuse to take charge of treasure insecurely packed, reporting the reasons for so doing to his superiors. He will, if he is satisfied, sign the receipt at the foot of each copy of the invoice. The blanks will be filled up in words and, if the escort officer be ignorant of English/Hindi, he will be required to write the number of the bags or boxes, which he has received, in the language he knows on the copy of the invoice to be retained by the Treasury Officer. When the escort officer is relieved in the course of the journey, he will obtain a receipt. If any box be of short weight or shows sign of having been tampered with, it should be opened in the presence of the escort officer, otherwise he should be allowed to return at once.

350.3 Before the cash/treasure is loaded in a van, the officer in charge of the escort shall examine the van and see that it is secure in all respect. If any defects are found, he shall immediately bring the matter to the notice of the railway stationmaster and if they are not remedied or another secured van is not provided, he shall decline to load the treasure, reporting the grounds therefore to his superiors.

350.4 The treasure must be deposited in the van in the presence of the entire guard, after which the van shall be locked on both sides. The guard will be furnished with an extra padlock of best quality for each door to be used in addition to any lock furnished by the railway. If there be only one lock, the key shall be held by the concerned officer of treasure/bank but the escort officer is responsible to ensure that the wagon is not opened either before arrival at destination or in case of a breakdown, when the treasure has to be moved to another wagon in his presence.

# Home Guards Organisation

# Introduction

368. There are a number of organizations, which are headed and staffed by police officers of various ranks, but these are not an integral part of the main police system. They, of course, support and supplement the working and functioning of the police organization. These organizations are called sister police organizations. Home Guards and Civil Defence Department is one of such sister organization of police. The Home Guards Organisation is intended to provide trained volunteers to help, assist, supplement and handle essential services like electricity, transport, fire services, water works, nursing and first aid through its functional units, as an auxiliary to the police. Home guards will perform the duties and tasks assigned by the organization to which they are deputed and are subject to all responsibilities and obligations attached to that post or duty. They will exercise the powers and enjoy the protections attached to the organization by which they are employed.

# Composition

The service in home guards is not an office of profit and is not a disqualification for contesting and being elected to any of the local bodies including the State Legislature. It should be noted that this does not apply to those home guards who are regularly employed with the Government and are serving as Home Guards.

# Powers and Functions of Supervisory Officers (1) Commandant, Home Guards

The DSP is designated as Addl./Deputy Commandant, Home Guards and should assist the Commandant and be responsible for the work of enrollment, training, deployment and other matters including office administration. He should supervise the work of Reserve Inspectors and other staff posted under him for training of the Home Guards. He should ensure that the training is imparted according to the course content finalized by the Commandant General.

372.1 The Commandant home guards should maintain a register, which should reflect the full particulars of each home guard including his skills and the special training, which has been imparted to him as well as the departments where he would be useful. This register should be updated from time to time. He should assess the requirements in emergencies of various essential services departments in emergencies and ensure that a proper proportion in each skill is maintained on the roles of the home guards organization.

# Strength, Enrollment and Training

373. The strength of Home Guards shall be as determined by the Government from time to time. The relative strength of the two categories also shall be as determined by the Government. However, since the cost of Home Guards is borne by the Government of India. they have allotted certain practical targets for the home guards in each state. The IG Home Guards should in consultation with the Unit officers assess the practical needs of the State in the light of the situations that have to be faced and forward proposals for enhancement of the strength after approval by the Director General of Police and the Commandant General of Home Guards.

373.1 The Home Guards is a voluntary organization and almost all ranks up to company level are volunteers. A small number of full time paid staff for training, command and control is authorized at city/town, district and state levels. After completion of their prescribed tenure they are eligible for re-enrolment. Retention of home guards over a long period erodes the voluntary character of the organization. As far as possible unemployed persons should not be retained as home guards over a long period so as to preserve the voluntary character of the organization.

373.2 The Committee consisting of SP/CP and two other members, for their respective areas, recruits the home guards. They are trained by police officers at the district training centres or any of the other training institutions where facilities are available. The training will be of 2 months duration in PT, elementary foot and arms drill and other modules consisting of work in electricity, transport, communications, fire fighting, rescue, medical and health, civil defence, police and such other essential services as may be prescribed for the functional units. In every district and city Home Guards should have adequate number of functional units based on an assessment of requirement in emergencies.

373.3 The eligibility for recruitment as a home guard is following:

Should be a citizen of India   
He or she should have completed 18 years on the date of enrolment.   
Those who are above 50 years are not eligible   
He/she should have passed VII Class   
Should possess $1 6 5 \mathrm { c m }$ in height in case of men. In case of women $1 5 0 \mathrm { c m }$ height and $4 0 ~ \mathrm { k g }$ of weight. The measurements are relaxable in case of Scheduled Tribes and technically qualified persons such as drivers, wireless operators, telephone operators, and those who can handle electrical equipment, water works, fire fighting, first aid etc.   
Should be of satisfactory character and antecedents. While verifying the character and antecedents the criteria to be adopted should be that persons belonging to or associated with any objectionable activity or programme should be considered undesirable for enrolment. The objectionable activities consist of those organizations which are unlawful, aimed at subversion of the Constitution, violent activity, promoting enemity on grounds of religion, caste etc. and those prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of India.   
Should be medically fit

373.4 The Committee will do the recruitment in January and July every year. The recruitment procedure is not similar to the normal procedures of recruitment for Government employment. Since the home guards service is of a voluntary nature and persons who are capable of handling certain specialist jobs and operations are required to be enrolled, the SP/CP should give wide publicity to various Government and private organizations to sponsor volunteers from different trades and levels, working in their organizations. The departments, which directly run essential services, need not be approached. Regarding persons who are not employed anywhere suitable announcement locally may be made so that volunteers may approach the designated officer for enrollment. The Commandant/DSP home guards should maintain a list of persons who approach them for enrollment and call them whenever vacancies are to be filled. Every announcement made should clearly indicate that it is a voluntary service and not an employment.

373.5 The volunteers enrolled are trained for 2 months initially. The course content of the induction training shall be as determined by the Commandant General Home Guards. It shall specifically include physical training, elementary drill including arms drill and other subjects, which would be necessary for the discharge of allotted duties. The training in special skills of different categories for functional units should be arranged with those institutions or establishments on a continuous basis. The attendance at weekly parades is also intended to update the home guards and should not be confined only to exercises and drill. The venue for initial training will be the district/Unit training centres or other training establishments. There shall be a Central Training Institute for Home Guards for training of trainers and orientation courses for various honorary rank holders and officers of the organization. The District Training Centre and the Central Training Institute shall be organized and run on the lines indicated in the Compendium.

# Utilization of Home Guards in Police Department

374. Home guards are deployed on a large scale in the police department for assistance in various duties that the police is called upon to perform. The deployment of home guards in police is usually for a long duration and hence the number mostly consists of the unemployed volunteers. In fact these volunteers consider the remuneration that they receive for the service as a source of employment even though it is not an appointment in the service of the police. The following guidelines and directions are issued for compliance in the matter of deployment and utilization of home guards in the police department.

374.1 The home guards may be utilized as guards, station watch, assistance to station writer, in bandobust of fairs and festivals, traffic regulation, patrolling etc. Those home guards who are utilized for these duties, if not accompanied or commanded by police officers will not derive any of the police powers unless they are appointed as special police officers or additional police officers in terms of the relevant provisions of the Police Act. The Unit officers should be aware of this and take action suitably to ensure that the home guards if deployed on their own, do not suffer from this handicap in dealing with the task, which is assigned to them.

374.2 When deployed on any of the duties and above they should be treated in the same manner as any other police officer and should be given all facilities that they are entitled. No deployment of home guards on the above duties should be done unless they are properly trained. The initial training of 2 months is not adequate for deploying them on regular police duties. Hence whenever such duties are to be performed, particularly those relating to guards dealing with agitations or bandobusts, an orientation course should be conducted before deployment apart from briefing.

374.3 Firearms should be issued, only after they have gone through the training and the Division/Zone firing practice in that weapon prescribed for a Civil Police Constable. No deployment for mob dispersal duty should be made unless they have been trained even for a short duration, in mob control and lathi drill and briefed on the implication of use of force and the need for use of minimum force and also about the right to private defence. It is not desirable to utilize home guards for such purposes as far as possible.

374.4 The observation and picket duties and assistance in patrolling are the proper methods of utilization of home guards. Trained drivers in the home guards organization may be utilized for driving of police vehicles. Similarly the home guards who are trained in wireless telephone may be utilized to man the control room as also the mobiles which carry police parties.

374.5 They should not be utilized for any menial or orderly duties such as personal service or at the residences of police officers or others. arrangements for feeding and transport at Government cost should be made for the Home Guards along with the Police while being deployed on police duty for bandobust.

374.6 Women home guards should be utilized for searches and other occasions when the presence of women is necessary or mandatory. They may also be utilized to guard women prisoners in custody or escorting women prisoners. While escorting there should be at least one police officer man or woman with the home guards. The uniform and other dress articles should be provided without delay. The officers in charge should inspect and make sure that the supply of uniform and distribution is done regularly.

374.7 Home guards should not be utilized for investigation duty. They should also not be utilized to assist in the maintenance of police registers. They may however, if trained or have the skill of typewriting or shorthand or computer handling may be utilized for assisting in the maintenance of records or drafting of reports by officers occasionally and not as a substitute for the ministerial establishment. It should be remembered that clerical jobs are not part of essential service and do not strictly come within the purview of police duties. It should be ensured that it is only to assist in police duties that the home guards should be deployed in the department and not for those duties for which the police officers themselves are not employed.

# Fixation of the Strength of Home Guards of each Unit

375. The Government from time to time fixes the strength of home guards. The SP or the CP in consultation with the requisitioning departments and proposals sent to the Government should make the assessment as to the actual need for home guards in each unit. The needs of each department and the nature of emergency that arises normally, the number required to maintain minimum level of service should be prepared in consultation with the concerned department. For example, in respect of electricity, the services required to maintain the supply in times of strikes or emergencies which cause breakdown of supply, the exact number of skilled and trained persons needed for the assistance of the Technical Managers should be assessed. Similar assessment for other departments including police should be made.

375.1 The duration of emergencies, their frequency, the exact positions to be manned should be a relevant factor. The nature of natural calamities and other disasters particularly those occurring frequently like floods, cyclones and fire in a particular area should be one of the factors in determining the strength.

375.2 The entire strength of home guards is not intended to be deployed all the time. Based on the above considerations the average man-hours should be calculated and a figure arrived at. Since the maximum deployment of an employed person is limited to 60 days in a year, a suitable additionally will have to be built in to the calculation before the final figure is arrived at in respect of each department.

# Awards and Recognition

376. The members of the organisation are eligible for President's Home Guards and Civil Defence Medal and Home Guards and Civil Defence Medal for conspicuous acts of gallantry, outstanding devotion to duty and distinguished/meritorious service. They are also eligible for cash awards and Director General, Civil Defence Commendation Certificates. The recommendation for these awards is made as per guidelines mentioned in this regard.

# Welfare

377. The members of the organization are eligible for compensation for injuries during training/duty. Home Guard volunteers who suffer death/injury during training/duty are to be provided death/injury benefits on the same basis as applicable to the police personnel engaged in similar operations. The payment in respect of death-cum-injury benefits is to be made by the agency for which the Home Guards are working. An amount of Rs. 1000/- may be sanctioned as ex-gratia grant for funeral expenses in case of death. A group insurance scheme to cover death-cum-injury will be implemented by the Government on the lines of the scheme already in existence for the police personnel. With a view to improve the professional standards of performance of home guards and civil defence organizations and to foster espirit-de-corps among their members. All India Home Guards and Civil Defence Professional and Sports Meets are held every year in rotation in different States or Union Territories.

# Civil Defence

378. Civil defence is to be organized as integral part of the defence of the country. It is an organization intended to prepare the people and build up an organization which can take care of the civil defence before, during and after enemy attacks either by land, air or sea. Aims of the civil defence are to save life, to minimize damage to property and to maintain continuity of production. The civil defence arrangements should be confined to selected places, vital plants and installations that should be reviewed from time to time. Civil Defence is to be organized primarily on a voluntary basis and should plan out such measures as are necessary. The Civil Defence Act 1968 provides for the formation of Civil Defence Corps and for making rules and regulations. The Act provides legal status for all measures connected with civil defence. The rules and regulations framed under the Act along with the amendments should be thoroughly read and understood by the Unit Officers.

378.1 At the State level there is a Controller of Civil Defence and Deputy Controllers located at various places. The Home Guards organization is complementary to the civil defence organisation. The civil defence corp as distinct from home guards is raised at the State. The Commissioner of Police and the District Magistrate in the districts are responsible for implementing civil defence programmes. The deputy controllers are provided on a full time basis for this work in the city and in the district. The organization, functioning and the schemes to be prepared and implemented transport, equipment, training etc. are covered in detail in the compendium of instructions on civil defence published by the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, by the Directorate General, Civil Defence in 1993. The instructions are communicated from time to time to all the officers.

378.2 The training programme of the police officers of all levels should include the subjects of civil defence and home guards in the induction courses. The IGP Home Guards should ensure that these modules are incorporated in the course content of training in all the Training Institutions. The police officers in the field at various levels should actively associate in planning and implementation of the civil defence measures as also in inculcating awareness about civil defence programmes in the course of their normal duties.

# Specific Contexts of Women Police

401. There are certain duties which men police officers are not expected to perform, or which women police officers can perform better. The special protection available to women and children and the gender bias that denies or deprives the women of their rights, require women police to be deployed for such police duties. The communication and confidence levels of women victims of crime would be substantially higher and more effective if women police officers handle their problems. It is in this context that definition of functions and duties of women police officers are indicated below.

# Women Police Stations and Women Protection Cell

404. Special arrangements are made for effective investigation of crimes against women and protection of women.

The women protection cell in CID is intended to monitor the crimes against women and take up serious cases for investigation. The safeguards and steps should be taken for protection of women and children by the police and treatment of women offenders. The existence of women police stations or women protection cell does not absolve the police as a whole of its duties in this respect. There is no bar either to post men police officers to women police stations or to the protection cell, except that it is necessary, that more women police officers than men are posted in those units.

# Duties and Powers of Women Police Officers

405. The duties of women police officers are the same as are assigned to all police officers, as are attached to the post to which they are posted. All instructions and obligations, code of conduct, discipline recruitment and training procedures are applicable to them.

# Chapter 23

# Central Police Organization

# Introduction

406. The raison de'etre of the maintenance of the Central Police Organisations (C.P.Os.) is that the ultimate responsibility of the Central Government regarding internal security is unquestionable. The active involvement of the Union Government in the matter of policing led to the creation of several C.P.Os. They are functioning as the specialist agencies besides being reserve forces with the Centre. The C.P.O. like BPR&D is responsible for carrying out the large part of research and modernization work related to police. CPOs like C.R.P.F., B.S.F., I.T.B.P., N.S.G. and Assam Rifles etc. constitute the reserves with the Centre. Central Industrial Security Force and Railway Protection Force protect the huge property of the Central Government. The Central Bureau of Investigation is for higher level investigation. Assistance to the state police forces for scientific aids to investigation, modernization and research is provided through the Bureau of Police Research and Development, and its subordinate organizations such as Central Forensic Science Laboratories, Central Detective Training School etc.

# The Classification

407. The Union Government has a variety of units of Central Police Organisations which can be classified as line, mixed and staff units. The line agencies are meant for actual field work. Staff agencies are obviously for institutional, academic or coordination work. The mixed units have mixed functions and overlapping jurisdictions.

# Cooperation & Coordination Among the CPOs &

# State Police Organisation

408. As per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution police, policing and security matters happen to be the subject matter of the State and the Concurrent Lists. Accordingly, the civil police and general policing happens to be the subject matter of State Police, and the subjects like Central Police and Paramilitary Organisations, Internal Security, modernization of police and All India Services fall into the jurisdiction of the Concurrent List. These provisions of the Constitution envisage that the State Police Orgnisations and the CPOs are to work in close cooperation and coordination with one another. The help of these organisations, if required by the State Police Organisations, can be obtained only on the basis of the request being made by the State Government to the Central Govt. The Central Govt. would order the concerned CPO chief to render the requisite assistance and cooperation. In an emergent situation when the services of a particular CPO are required the DGP will assess the situation and would request the State Govt. to requisition the services of the concerned CPO. Once the forces and the personnel of the concerned CPO arrives in the State, it will be the responsibility of the concerned State Police Organisation to make available all facilities and conditions, which would be necessary for the smooth and effective functioning of the concerned force. Matters like boarding and lodging, transportation and communication should be properly looked after by the State Police Organisation and proper arrangements must be made for adequate cooperation and coordination between the CPO personnel and the State police personnel. The CPO should be retained only for the necessary time and period.

408.1 The contribution of the central police organizations to the policing of this country is outstanding and they have rendered a yeoman service to the nation in every part of the country in real hours of need.

# The Indispensability

409. The role of CPOs in the area of maintenance of internal security and emergency situations being faced by any State Police Organisation is very important and consequently the services of the CPOs many a times become indispensable for the State Police Organisations because of the situational constraints being faced by them. Even the resource constraints of the State Police Organisations in this context are quite obvious. Moreover, the state police forces are heavily overworked. They are only able to carry out their routine duties. Anything extra goes out of their reach. Whenever a law and order problem develops, be it a riot or an election bandobast or Kumbha Mela like arrangements, there is no way out but to take the help of central police organisations. The task of combating terroristic activities, border patrolling, anti-smuggling and anti-dacoity operations are almost exclusively being done by the central police organisations. Special areas like industrial and railway security are covered by the CPOs Even for the regular crime investigation work the state police have their own limitations. At times the sheer complexity of the cases and sometimes the demand for a fairer investigation make it necessary to requisition the services of CPO like CBI. Then there are certain things which by their very nature can not be dealt with by the state police agencies. Co-ordination with Interpol or intelligence operations abroad, espionage and counter espionage etc. fall in this category. They have to be undertaken by the central organisations only. Similarly matters like police research and development, training of I.P.S. officers, research facilities in forensic science and criminology and crime records and statistics can not be taken up locally and their national level operations demand CPOs to manage them.

409.1 The central police organisations exist and have to continue because logic commends it and necessity demands it. The country confronts such a multitude of problems that at present and even in conceivable future also it just cannot reasonably be expected that the state police forces alone will be able to provide adequate policing to the nation. The role played by the central govt. and the CPOs in policing is not only a desirable reality but is logically required also.

# Emerging New Trends

410. To give better policing to the nation and for effective goal achievement certain specific modifications, additions, alterations and developments are required in centre's role in policing. The CPOs have grown considerably in size and numbers which establishes their increasing importance and relevance in the system. Evolving a truly modern and effective police system for the country shall have to induct far ranging changes in the organizational structure, procedures, attitudes, approach and outfits of the existing CPOs. There is scope for improvement in almost every area, be it a matter of organizational structure or centre state relations. Basing on a comprehensive review of the centre's role in police functions and the central police organizations it has been discovered that there are several important issues which deserve special consideration for the ultimate betterment of Indian police with regard to the CPOs.

410.1 The country today faces a number of unprecedented problems. Several States are beset with problems of extremist movements, terrorism and even counter insurgency. Keeping the present circumstances and their most likely trends in future, the Centre must play a more dynamic and more active role in policing the CPOs. The following points need special considerations.

# (A) Financial Inputs Should Improve

411. States receive financial aid from the Centre for modernization of their police forces CPOs also need better financial support. There should be a permanent central agency for this purpose. This standing agency should advise the M.H.A. on the quantum of financial assistance that should be made available to each state and the CPO. They should monitor the utilization of the funds and report their assessments to the M.H.A. The proper monitoring would ensure better utilization of funds resulting in better policing.

# (B) Improvement Police Research and Development

412. The resources for research and development should be optimally utilized. This can only be done by laying more emphasis on research. The country ought to spend more on research, evolve modern techniques and make optimal utilization of resources. The B.P.R. & D. should be given more voice and made to play a more dynamic role. The Centre's funding out the research units of the states should be done strictly through B.P.R. & D. There is urgent need of bringing police R. and D. and training in the plan sector.

# (C) Zonal Location

413. The country is now facing complex law and order problems because of terrorism, insurgency and divisive forces. Frequent deployment of CPOs under these circumstances may be required. The deployment of CPOs may take some time for movement. However, many situations can be so urgent or rapidly deteriorating that a much quicker deployment would be desirable. For such situations the concept of Zonal location and stationing of CPOs should be considered and the Centre should take initiative in the matter. The location should be done in such a manner so as to be able to mobilize the CPO force from one State to another within the shortest possible period.

# (D) Better Scientific Aids

414. The matter of scientific aids to CPOs should be taken on a systematic footing. The proper provisioning of scientific aids to police and their coordinated growth, functions related to forensic science should be placed under the B.P.R. & D to enable them to work as expert adviser in matters relating to provision of central grants to state FSLs, CPOs and the State Police Organisations.

# (E) Training Coordination

415. Better policing results from better training. There ought to be a central police coordinating authority to attend to training matters so that the multitude of training agencies is eliminated. The B.P.R. & D. can be strengthened to coordinate the training programmes of various C.P.Os. without impinging on their administrative independence.

# (F) Development of new Dynamics in C.P.Os.

416. CPOs have been of great help in the policing of the nation. As times change, the nature of problems also undergoes the corresponding changes; therefore, CPOs should accordingly undergo changes to obtain new dynamics to handle the new challenges.

# (G) C.P.Os as Specialized Agencies

417. The CPOs ought to be evolved as specialist agencies. Their training, the outfit and the organization should be modified to develop into a specialized force. Some of the suggestions in this regard could be the following.

(a) To develop N.S.G. into a specialist anti-terrorist force it is essential that it is not only equipped suitably but imparted suitable training also. This means that the training should distance itself away from irrelevant infantry training part. It should focus on urban terrorism, rural terrorism, and almost jungle warfare as in the north east. It should have special equipment also. The N.S.G. ought to be expanded and developed into an anti-terrorist operation force of specialist variety.

(b) The C.R.P.F. and the B.S.F. should raise more commando units. The commandos should be selected from the force only keeping in view their physical fitness, courage and shooting ability. These commando units can successfully take up the job of anti-terrorist operations.

(c) The C.R.P.F. or at least a part of it should go for specialization in internal security duties to assist the State Police Organisations. The efficient riot police squads should also be developed. For anti smuggling operations the B.S.F. should be equipped with the latest instruments of narcotics and metal detection. Special vehicles which are capable of moving swiftly on sand, night vision devices and modern communication equipment should be made available to these CPOs.

# Interpol

418. The dynamic nature of transportation and communication has converted the world into a global village. Technological advancements have made it possible to commit serious crime without the mastermind and the conspiring criminals remaining present on the spot of crime. It has now become very easy for the criminal of one country to commit offence in the other country and even the criminal can make a quick disappearance after committing a crime in one country to another country. The victim country, because of the sovereignty of the other nation, where the wanted criminals are hiding, can not arrest them.

418.1 The nations of the world suffered due to these situations of criminality and criminals flourished in an unabated manner. To contain and control such criminal activities the nations of the world deliberated themselves and decided to devise a method or create an agency which could help them to resolve this problem. As a result the Interpol came into being as an international police organisation to help various nations of the world for controlling, containing and investigating the crimes of international ramification and for rendering help to the concerned nation in arresting the criminal involved in such crimes. Most of the nations of the world are its members.

418.2 The Interpol is an amalgamation of representatives taken on deputation from various countries who work in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations. The member country notifies to the Interpol its agency which will function on behalf of the nation. The Central Bureau of Investigation is such a notified agency on behalf of India. The Interpol maintains a huge databank on wanted criminal and on receipt of information from a country about a criminal, passes it on to the nation where the criminal is hiding. The Interpol thus works as a link between different nations and helps to combat the international crimes in an efficient manner.

418.3 For investigation of international crimes and arrest of criminals hiding in other countries, the State Police Organisation refers the matter to the CBI and the CBI in turn makes contact with the Interpol, who would work as a link between the two nations and make all help, assistance, coordination and cooperation enabling the concerned country to investigate the crime and arrest the criminal.
