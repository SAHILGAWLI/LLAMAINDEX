Chapter 1 

**Functions, Roles and Duties of Police in General** 

**Introduction** 

1. Police are one of the most ubiquitous organisations of the society. The policemen, therefore, happen to be the most visible representatives of the government. In an hour of need, danger, crisis and difficulty, when a citizen does not know, what to do and whom  to  approach,  the  police  station  and  a  policeman  happen  to  be  the  most appropriate and approachable unit and person for him. The police are expected to be the most accessible, interactive and dynamic organisation of any society. Their roles, functions and duties in the society are natural to be varied, and multifarious on the one hand; and complicated, knotty and complex on the other. Broadly speaking the twin roles, which the police are expected to play in a society are maintenance of law and maintenance of order. However, the ramifications of these two duties are numerous, which  result  in  making  a  large  inventory  of  duties,  functions,  powers,  roles  and responsibilities of the police organisation.

**Conflict Resolution Contexts of Police Role** 

7. Confronting, facing and handling of conflicting situations of various sorts happen to be an integral part of police role performance and police working. Police have to face  numerous  situations,  where  the  contending  parties  on  various  issues,  put  up conditions before them, which in some way or the other, obtain the shape of conflicts. In most cases which the police handle, whether during investigations or maintenance of order, there are often two or more contending individuals, parties and issues which are expected to be resolved by police. Conflict resolution, thus, becomes an essential part of overall police functioning. Needless to say that policemen will be able to discharge their various duties and functions better, if they obtain good understanding of  the  philosophy,  principles  and  tenets  of  conflict  resolution  and  conflict management. 

   **Conflict Resolution Scenario of Police** 

8. Police, particularly at the field level, face following situations, in addition to others, pertaining to conflict resolution : 
1) Citizens come to police with various complaints against one others which are in the form of conflicts. 
1) There are issues, which themselves are in the nature of conflicts and the citizens expect the police to resolve them. 
1) In  almost  all  cases  which  the  police  handle  there  are  two  or  more contending  parties,  and  there  are  adversarial  situations  which  generate conflicts. 
1) The contending parties can create inter-group or intra-group conflicts like the complainant(s) or accused person(s) could be separate and well marked groups  contending  on  separate  and  specific  issues,  and  at  times,  there might be conflicting situations among these groups themselves which may give rise to intra-group conflicts. 
1) The conflicts, which the police face and handle, could be issue, individual and law based. 
1) In most conflict cases before police, they are often not themselves part of the conflicting situations, but at times, they while handling these cases come  in  clash  with  the  issues,  parties  and  situations,  and,  thus,  they become part of the conflict and their status and position in the context of conflict resolution become topsy-turvy. 
1) In order to avoid such situations and for empowering police to handle and resolve  the  conflicts  in  a  better  way,  they  should  be  well-equipped  in academic, administrative, psychological and legal contexts. 

**Conflict : Conceptualization**  

9. The realism of the term conflict is quite fluid, dynamic and ambiguous in nature. It may mean different things to different people. The gamut of conflict is also quite vast. It may range from a simple situation like a debate or an argument on an issue to varied  situations  like  disagreement,  contest,  dispute,  quarrel,  struggle,  unrest, confrontation,  turmoil  and  chaos.  The  situation  of  conflict,  thus,  is  opposite  to cooperation, harmony, accord and peace. A conflict arises when parties disagree about the distribution of material or symbolic resources, or an issue and act on the basis of their  perceived  incompatibilities  may  also  become  subject  matter  of  a  conflicting situation. A conflict, therefore, is a perceptual and behavioural reality which is a result of  an  individual’s  or  a  group’s  perception  of  incompatibility  about  an  issue  or  a situation. These perceptions of the incompatibility may be subjective in nature. A conflict is a generic phenomenon and happens to be interactive and dynamic process rather than a static condition or an event. A policeman should view the conflict in its totality for its appropriate resolution.

   **Causes of Conflict** 

10. There  can  be  an  end  number  of  reasons  for  emergence  and  birth  of  various conflicts. Women, wealth, property, rights, claims, interests, ego, resource allocation, religion,  ideologies,  governance,  partisan  attitudes,  etc,  etc.  can  be  some  of  the reasons which may give rise to conflicts. These causes could be classified in two categories i.e. underlying causes and immediate causes. The basis of various conflicts could be personal, social, cultural, political, religious, psychological, anthropological, administrative and legal. The police officer handling a conflict should go into its roots and should see the various facets of the conflict and should also look into the various legal aspects while bringing about its resolution.  

    **Stages of Conflict** 

11. A conflict is a dynamic situation and it passes through various stages. These stages move through in a life cycle situation, from its emergence to its resolution. These stages could be : Formation, Escalation, Endurance, Improvement, Settlement or Resolution, Reconstruction and Reconciliation. 
1. At the formation stage, a situation of conflict moves from its latent state to manifest state. At the latent state, a conflict remains in the nature of social tensions, differences and disagreements which are hidden and under developed. At the manifest state a conflict becomes more prominent and more central in its overall dynamics. At this stage a conflict reaches threshold of confrontation, clash and even violence. A police officer should keep a close watch on the latent state of conflicts, particularly the ones which have Law and Order, communal and terrorism overtones. If these situations  are  handled  effectively  at  the  stage  of  formation,  great  damage  can  be avoided, if the dormant situations of criminality and Law and Order are not tackled efficiently and timely, they might not only get manifested in graver forms and may even degenerate into worse forms and may obtain its next stage called escalation. The police officers should make best of their efforts when the situations of conflict are in a state of escalation, because if they are not properly handled at this stage, they will obtain a state of resistance and endurance. Handling of conflict, at this stage, indeed, is a tough and difficult task. Use of force might be required. With appropriate use of force, the deteriorating situations may be put to a state of improvement, which would reduce  the  persisting  endurance  and  resistance  to  a  de-escalating  state.  When  a conflict reaches this stage, its settlement and resolution will become smoother and easier.  A  conflict  resolution  would  require  the  following  seven  dimensional mechanism. 
- Completeness  *-*  the  issues  in  the  conflict  have  disappeared  or  cease  to  be important 
- Acceptability - the outcome is acceptable to all parties, not just to one or to their elites 
- Self supporting - there is no necessity for third party sanctions to maintain the agreement 
- Satisfactory - all parties perceive the outcome as just according to their value system 
- Uncompromising - no goals have been sacrificed in the form of compromise solutions 
- Innovative  -  the  solution  establishes  new,  positive  and  legitimate  relations between the parties 
- Unforced - the agreement was arrived at without imposition by an outside force. 
2. These criteria are extremely demanding and few conflicts can be said to have ended so completely. A satisfactory settlement of a conflict is often the best result that can be attained. However, keeping the various desirable aspects of conflict resolution in mind, may help in producing settlements that are more satisfactory and likely to lead, in the long run to a genuine resolution. 

   **Intervention Levels** 

12. For an effective resolution of conflicts timely intervention at the following levels is required :  
- Personal 
- Local 
- National 
- Regional 
- International or Global 
1. Intervention for conflict resolution should adopt the following strategies : 
   1. Step-by-step 
   1. Procedural framework 
   1. End picture 
1. The  step-by-step,  procedural  framework  and  the  end  picture  strategies  of intervention focus on different aspects of conflict resolution on different time scales. These aspects need to be integrated in a comprehensive process of conflict resolution and transformation. These strategies are, thus, complementary to one another. 

**Methods, Modalities and Strategies of Conflict Resolution** 

13. Conflict resolution is a comprehensive outcome in which underlying causes of the conflict are removed so that no latent and residual elements are left unattended to avoid triggering off and recurrence of the conflict. The various methods, modalities and strategies of conflict resolution could take recourse to the following points, in addition to others, which are deemed fit and proper, with regard to the conflict in question. 
1) Early warning and prevention 
1) Reconstruction and reconciliation 
1) Conflict transformation 
1) Negative and positive peace 
5) Consultation 
5) Conciliation 
5) Mediation 
5) Negotiation 
5) Arbitration 
5) Problem solving  
5) People-participation in conflict resolution 
5) Multi-track interventions 

**Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Approach** 

14. The concept of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) encompasses a variety of methods or techniques that are used as alternatives to full-scale court processes. This involves participation and role of a neutral third person to resolve conflict that persists between the two parties. The third person assists and helps the contending parties in developing a workable solution to their problems outsides the court room. ADR, thus, is a procedure that is used to resolve issues in any controversy including, but not limited  to,  conciliation,  facilitation,  mediation,  fact-finding,  quasi  or  mini  trial, arbitration and use of ombudsman or any combination of the above. Most common of the ADR techniques are arbitration and mediation. 

    **Various Facets  and Features of ADR** 

15. Some of the important facets and features of ADR are following: 
- ADR provides a private, non-adversarial approach to resolving conflicts and disputes. This is a useful option and alternative to the traditional litigation forms in the public courts. 
- It  does  not  subject  contending  parties  to  the  rigor  of  the  adversarial  court system. 
- Over a period   of time, ADR as a mechanism of justice has found a niche in democratic, social and justice contexts. 
- ADR integrates a myriad of cooperative measures which enrich the quality of information exchange between the contending parties and fosters cooperation, promotes efficient settlements and agreements, develops outcomes of mutual 

  gains, reduces legal costs; improve the quality and acceptability of outcomes. 

- ADR  has  a  positive  potential  to  affect  the  long  term  of  relationships  of contending parties. 
- ADR has been successfully applied in issues concerning labor management and employment matters, family discord and domestic strife, petty criminal cases, business  affairs,  public  disputes,  environmental  concerns  and  intellectual differences. 
- ADR has provided a useful alternative to the adversarial justice system and has given relief to various vulnerable groups like women, juvenile, workers etc. 
- ADR presents an effective alternative to resolve disputes and includes in its ambit  the  collaborative  approaches  to  reach  agreements  such  as  unassisted negotiations and assisted problems solving, as well as, voluntary third party decision making procedures. 
- The spirit of ADR mechanism is to create a Win-Win- situation in place of Win- Lose situation of the adversarial system. 

**Objective of ADR** 

16. Some of the goals and objectives of ADR are following: 
1) To reduce delay in the resolution of disputes 
1) To by-pass ineffective and discredited court procedure and system 
1) To increase popular satisfaction with dispute resolution 
1) To increase access to justice for disadvantaged groups 
1) To support and complement court efforts 
1) To reduce the cost of resolving disputes 
1) To  provide  individual  satisfaction,  individual  autonomy,  social  control, social justice, social solidarity and personal transformation 

**Police Prerequisites in the ADR Contexts**  

17. ADR, as a mechanism of conflict resolution is not very popular and acceptable in the police working because police are an integral part of the adversarial system in India. If the ADR is required to be made part of the police functioning, following 

    prerequisites are needed to be introduced and implemented. 

- Awareness 
- Acceptability 
- Utility 
- Adoption 
- Cooperation 
- Coordination 
- Participation 
18. Since the policemen are expected to work and function in the given legal frame work, their awareness about the ADR mechanism is quite inadequate. Consequently, the acceptability level and the level of the use and utility about the ADR mechanism is also quite inadequate. If ADR is to be adopted for the police department, and for their functioning, the level of awareness, acceptability and utility shall have to be improved. Police department, by dint of their role, functions and overall contribution to the justice system are in a position to cooperate, coordinate and participate in the ADR system. This is an appropriate time for introducing and adopting ADR in the police department. An appropriate committee should be set up to examine the extent, nature and scope of ADR in the police department. 

    **Precautions** 

19. Following  precautions  should  be  taken  for  using  and  utilizing  the  ADR mechanism in the police department. 
1. Police  are  not  meant  to  be  a  pure  mechanism  of  ADR.  However,  their working, performance and functioning do have an intrinsic worth and value which can be used and utilized for ADR in a restricted, disciplined and limited manner. 
1. Police  can  put  in  sincere  and  honest  efforts  to  facilitate  the  contending parties to reach solution of their disputes, at their own level, particularly in petty, compoundable and ordinary criminal cases. 
1. While playing the role of a facilitator, helping the parties to the ADR, the 

   police should always remain fair, impartial and neutral and must always avoid a partisan attitude and approach. 

4. Their approach and attitude should not be infected with ulterior motives and vested interest. 
4. ADR approach to police working can be usefully utilized in the area of Law and  Order  maintenance,  non-cognizable  cases  and  the  cases  which  have overtones of being resolved by ADR efforts. 
4. Police personnel at all ranks should be suitably re-oriented to the concept, application  and  areas  relevant  to  police  functioning  with  regard  to  the realism of application of conflict resolution techniques to various facets of police roles, duties and working. 
4. This  re-orientation  is  possible  by  exposing  police  personnel  to  various academic courses, like the one, available at The Vardhaman Mahaveer Open University,  Kota  (Rajasthan)  on  conflict  resolution  or  alternatively  short term specialized courses on the subject can be organized in collaboration with the police training schools and the open universities like The VMOU, Kota (Raj.).

**Functions, Roles and Duties of Superior Police Officers** 

**Introduction** 

20. The hierarchy of the police organisation can broadly be divided in two categories i.e.  Superior  Officers  and  Junior  Officers.  The  superior  officers  work  in  the supervisory and controlling capacity with regard to the units which they occupy at a particular point of time. They issue instructions, guidance and orders, which help and assists the junior officers in the discharge of their various functions. Every senior officer is empowered to exercise the powers vested in his subordinate officers and men.

The superior officers can be categorized as Central services officers and State service officers. The Central service officers  are  called  IPS  officers  and  the  State  service  officers  are  designated  in accordance  with  the  State  to  which  they  belong.  The  IPS  officers  work  as  top management officers and middle management officers.

   **Constables** 

38. A Constable has maximum interface with public. As the most accessible person for public, he is expected to protect the needy, rescue people from danger, apprehend offenders and assist in securing prompt help and justice. Some of the important roles assigned  to  him  are  organizing  and  securing  community  participation,  activising himself  in  prevention  and  detection  of  crime  and  maintenance  of  law  and  order. Another main role of the Constable is, performance of all tasks connected with beat area and there by help in prevention of offence and breach of peace. The constable on traffic duty has the task of regulating traffic. All constables in their dealings with public should inspire confindence in the efficacy of police to protect them. The police image is directly proportionate to their good conduct and behaviour in the public as they are the persons who are basically and directly in touch with them. At all costs they must avoid ill treatment either to the victims or to the accused as a first step to build the better police image. The main duties of civil Constables are; 
1. To perform duties in beats, patrols and pickets and to keep surveillance over history sheeted and other potential criminals as per orders 
1. Collection of information and intelligence relating to crimes and criminals, subversive,  terrorist  and  anti  social  elements  in  their  areas  primarily  and communication of the same to the authorized superiors 
1. Developing  cordial  relations  with  local  citizen  committees/voluntary organizations  and  knowledge  of  households  in  the  beat  area  and  convey information relating to persons and events that cause or likely to cause law and order situation or wide spread disturbances 
1. Keep in touch with local disputes, caste/communal overtones and inform SHO 
1. Assistance  to  investigating  officers  in  the  matter  of  arrests,  recoveries, searches,  identification  and  securing  of  witnesses  or  verification  of information  and  execute  warrants  and  serve  summons  promptly,  escort prisoners, arrested persons, escort injured or dead to the hospital, guard of prisoners in custody and all station property. 
6. Help  and  assist  in  dealing  with  Floods,  Earthquakes,  Fires,  Accidents, Epidemics etc. and put in responsible efforts to save lives and property and to perform allotted duties in Fairs, Festivals, Bundhs, Agitations, Riots, Large Assemblies, Elections, Bandobust and security duties. 
6. To preserve and guard the scene of occurrence until necessity ceases. 
6. To  behave  courteously  with  all  sections  of  public  and  treat  poor  people, children, women, aged and all weaker sections of society with consideration, sympathy and helpful attitude. 
6. To  be  regular  and  punctual  in  his  duties,  catechism,  physical  training  and weekly parades. 
6. To work as data entry operators in Computers and in the areas of reprography, photography and cartography wherever they have necessary skill. 
6. To  meet  the  common  people  in  his  beat  on  a  regular  basis  and  maintain rapport with the public representatives. 
6. To visit the victims of crime and keep them updated about the investigation of their cases, except where the identity of the victims needs to be kept secret or where the victim wants no interference.  
6. To keep a list of senior citizens living alone and visit them occasionally. 
6. To keep a list of vital installations and places of worship and maintain watch over the same. 
6. To keep a track of any brewing social, religious or sectarian conflict/ unrest.

6. To make entries in the prescribed register and forms and maintain records entrusted to him particularly those relating to beat area. 
6. Any other duties allotted by SHO or other superior officers or elsewhere in this manual. 

38\.1 The entire preventive work of the police depends on the efficiency, commitment, professionalism and integrity of the beat area policeman. The Constable allotted to a beat should realize that his participation in the community even in a small measure is essential  for  successful  policing.  Professionalism  and  integrity  but  not  power  and authority shall command respect and bring in a large measure of co-operation from general public. 

Chapter 4 

**Registration of Crime & First Information Report** 

**Introduction** 

39. Police organisation, in any society, is said to be the chief law enforcement agency of  the  criminal  justice  administration.  Crimes  and  offences  of  general  nature  are, therefore,  registered  and  investigated  by  the  police  stations.  Police  station  is  the primary and basic unit of crime registration in all civilized societies. The common man whether victim, complainant or informer contacts police stations in the event of commission of a crime. It is expected that the police station will immediately take action  on  the  report  received  by  it  and  would  register  the  crime  for  initiating appropriate and adequate action in the matter. Any lapse on the part of police in this regard will land them in a situation of criticism. Registration of crime and recording of an FIR is thus, one of the fundamental duties of the police. 

    **Classification of Offences** 

40. Offences  of  various  types,  as  per  the  provisions  of  CrPC,  are  classified  as cognizable  and  non-cognizable  offences.  The  offences  in  which  police  can  arrest without warrant are classified as cognizable offences and the other ones are known as non-cognizable offences. On receipt of a report about commission of a cognizable offence, it should be recorded in the prescribed format, and this process is called recording of First Information Report (FIR). 

    **The First Information Report (FIR)** 

41. Information of the commission of a cognizable crime that shall first reach the police, whether oral or written, shall be treated as the First Information. It may be given by a person acquainted with the facts directly or on hearsay, but in either case it constitutes the First Information required by law, upon which the investigation under Section 157, Criminal Procedure Code, shall be taken up. When hearsay information of a crime is given the Station House Officer shall not wait to record as the first 

    information the statement of the actual complainant or an eye-witness. 

    **Rumour, Hearsay & FIR** 

42. A vague rumour should be distinguished from an oral report and should not be reduced to writing or signed by the informant but merely entered in the Station House Diary and should it, on subsequent information, prove well founded, such subsequent information shall constitute the First Information. If the rumour is in regard to the occurrence  of  a  serious  crime,  the  Station  House  Officer  must  embark  upon  an immediate enquiry to verify its authenticity and, if found true, obtain a complaint and register  and  investigate  it.  Police  Officers  shall  not  defer  drawing  up  the  First Information Report until they have tested the truth of the complaint. They shall not await the result of medical examination before recording the First Information when a complaint is made of grievous hurt or other cognizable crime. 

    **Telephonic & Telegraphic Information and FIR** 

43. It is of utmost importance to secure all particulars regarding the occurrence in the first instance and to record them in detail. Care should also be taken to see if the complaint is trying to exaggerate an actual occurrence or trying to give the colour of a cognizable  case  to  an  incident  of  a  non-cognizable  nature.  Complaints  made  by telegram or telephone should not be recorded in the First Information Report until the information  has  been  verified  and  either  a  statement  has  been  recorded  from  the sender in writing or a confirmatory written and signed complaint has been received from him. This does not mean that the Officer-in-charge of a Police Station need take no action on a telegraphic or telephonic complaint received by him. On receipt of a report  by  telegram  or  telephone  regarding  the  commission  of  serious  cognizable crime, he should make a note of it in the Station House Diary and hasten to the spot to verify the information and, if it is found to be true, he should obtain a complaint in writing or record the statement of the informer and send it to the Police Station for registration  and  immediately  embark  upon  its  investigation.  On  his  return  to  the Station House, he should also record the result of his enquiries in the Station House Diary. 

    **Procedure of Recording FIR & Subsequent Action** 

44. The  registration  of  a  cognizable  offence  shall  be  made  by  the  Police Inspector/Sub-Inspector, if he is present at the Police Station when a report is made. Once the report has been entered in the First Information Report, the investigation of the offence will be commenced at the scene of occurrence with the least possible delay, and the PI/Sub-Inspector will himself proceed to the spot. If there are reasons that render this impossible or unnecessary, he will depute a PSI/ASI/Head Constable to take up the investigation, and he will note in the First Information Report why he did not himself take up the investigation. In the absence of the PI/Sub-Inspector, the senior  most  officer  present  will  record  the  first  information  and  take  up  the investigation till relieved by the PI/Sub-Inspector or any other officer. 

    44\.1 The First Information Report shall invariably be written before the investigating officer  proceeds  to  make  an  investigation.  But,  if  a  report  of  a  serious  crime  is received by the Officer-in-charge of a Police Station, he must leave for the scene of offence directing the officer whom he places in-charge of the station or the station writer, as the case may be to register the case. For example, if a Station House Officer is informed that a serious breach of the peace is occurring in his jurisdiction or that a drunkard is running amuck with a weapon after inflicting serious injuries on persons, it is the duty of the Station House Officer to proceed to the scene at once and prevent the commission of further offences. He should not delay proceeding to the scene for the sake of issuing a First Information Report, which could be left to one of his subordinates. 

    **Information at the Outpost and FIR** 

45. If  the  first  informant  appears  at  an  outpost  with  or  without  a  report,  a  First Information Report should not be  issued by the Head Constable or Constable in- charge as he is not a Station House Officer as defined in Section 2(o) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He will enter the substance of the report in the Outpost Diary, send the first informant with a note in which he should record the date and the time at which the first informant appeared at the Outpost and the date and time at which he left for the Station, where the First Information Report will be issued. He will then proceed  to  the  scene  of  occurrence  and  will  take  steps  to  arrest  the  accused  and recover stolen property, if any, pending the arrival of the Station House Officer to conduct the investigation. 

    **First Information Report Book** 

46. Information coming under any of the following headings received at a Police Station, shall be registered in the First Information Report Book, which is the book prescribed under Section 154, Criminal Procedure Code: 
1) cognizable  cases  including  those  referred  to  the  Police  by  Magistrates  for investigation or inquiry under Sections 156 (3) and 202 Criminal Procedure Code; 
1) fires, missing of cattle and all other occurrences where there is reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence; 
1) non-cognizable cases endorsed to the Police by Magistrates for investigation or inquiry under Sections 155 (2) and 202 Criminal Procedure Code; 
1) cases under Sections 41, 102, 107 to 110 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, only one First Information Report being issued if more than one person is involved in a  case; 
1) reports made to Magistrates with a view to action being taken under Sections 144 and 145 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
1) Cases  under  Section  182  or  211  P.C.  when  it  is  proposed  to  prosecute  the complainant for false complaint, although not investigated under Section 155(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 

46\.1 Every report of a cognizable offence should be registered in the First Information Report book, even if it appears to be untrue, exaggerated or of civil nature. If the Officer-in-charge of a Police Station receives an oral report of a cognizable offence during  his  tour, he  should  take  down  the  report in  writing and  have  it  signed  or marked by the person who made it. He should then send it, with an endorsement duly signed by him, to the Police Station, where it will be treated as a written report and registered in the First Information Report book. In the meantime, he will himself commence the investigation. A First Information Report once recorded shall in no circumstances be withheld or cancelled by the Station House Officer. Cases entered in the First Information Report book will each be given a consecutive number, and this number will constitute the crime number for the purpose of subsequent references. As soon  as  the  report  has  been  entered  in  the  First  Information  Report  book,  the 

substance of the report must be briefly recorded in the Station House Diary. 

47. **Salient Points of Registration of an FIR** 
1. Write the First Information Report immediately with all available details, and enter the fact at the same time in the Station House Diary, mentioning therein the name of the complainant or informant (with father’s name, age, occupation and residence), the time of reporting at the Police Station and brief particulars of the report, including the crime number and section of law and action taken.  
1. Record all available facts of the case in unambiguous terms and make sure that no  important  point  is  omitted.  Use  copying  pencil  for  writing  the  First Information Report and make copies by carbon process.  
1. Do not make corrections, erasures, scorings or over-writings. If a correction is necessary, strike out the word or words, leaving them still legible, and initial.  
1. When the first informant presents his written report at the Police Station, read it and explain it to him. If he admits its correctness make on it an endorsement to that effect. Note on it the date and time of its receipt.  
1. If  the  written  report  reveals  the  commission  of  or  reasonable  grounds  to suspect the commission of, a cognizable offence, it is not necessary to record any further  statement.  Proceed  to  register  the  case  in  the  prescribed  form, making relevant entries in the Station House Diary. If the written report is lacking  in  details  of  the  articles  stolen  or  their  description  including  their identification marks, the names of persons who can identify them, etc., elicit them and record them at the foot of the report. The record made should be read and explained to the maker and attested by him. If the written reports does not contain  the  names  and  addresses  of  the  accused,  or  some  of  the  accused mentioned in the report have the same name, or the accused or some of them are not named but can be identified, their complete addresses to distinguish one from the other, and the descriptive marks of such of the accused as are to be identified, should be elicited and recorded. If the written report does not contain a list of the articles stolen and the first informant states that a list is under preparation and would be furnished, make a record to that effect at the foot of the report and obtain his attestation to it. If the written report is wanting in any other information but for which, the report cannot be said to contain all 

   the  information  falling  within  the  purview  of  Section  154  of  the  Code  of Criminal Procedure, question the first informant and if he is able to furnish it, record it at the foot of the report and obtain his attestation. 

6. If the first informant does not appear with his written report but makes an oral statement, reduce his oral statement to writing in the space provided in the First Information Report form. If one form is found insufficient, use another form. Record the First Information in the actual words of the informant, as the record should not be your impression of what he meant to say. Employ plain and simple language, as nearly as possible, in the informant’s words. Avoid technical or legal expressions of high-flown language.  
6. When,  after  the  First  Information  Report,  a  list  or  a  further  list  of  stolen property is furnished or obtained by police, ensure that it is signed by the persons concerned and record on it the date, time and place of its receipt. Do not keep the list referred to above in the case diary file. Retain its copy and send  the  original  to  the  court  for  being  attached  to  the  relevant  First Information Report. 

viii.  Whenever it is found that having regard to the time and date of occurrence, the 

distance from the place of occurrence to the Police Station and other relevant circumstances, the first informant has delayed lodging the First Information, elicit  from  him  a  full  and  detailed  account  of  the  circumstances  which contributed to such delay, while reducing to writing, his oral statement.  

9. If a first informant appears before an officer superior in rank to an Officer-in- charge of a Police Station, the former should reduce to writing his statement or he should see that the informant is produced before the Officer-in-charge of the Police Station, who should then record his statement. 
9. When an accused appears at a Police Station and lodges a First Information Report, it should be read and explained to him and if he admits its correctness, an endorsement to  that  effect should be  recorded.  If he appears without  a written report, his oral statement should be reduced to writing. In either case, if a cognizable offence is disclosed or there are reasonable grounds to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence, a case should be registered. 
9. When a cognizable offence is committed in the presence of an Officer-in-

   charge  of  a  Police  Station,  he  is  not  bound  to  take  down  in  writing  any information  relating  to  the  commission  of  the  offence.  Since  he  has  the information himself, he can register the case suo-moto. In cases registered suo-moto, satisfy yourself that the First Information Report contains a full and correct record of all the facts and circumstances relating to the offence and the offenders, including the names of witnesses, if any. 

12. When the First Information relates to theft, do not fail to ask the complainant to furnish a list of articles stolen, their value and any particulars as to weight, make, design or other distinguish marks which may assist identification, if they have not already been furnished. While eliciting the prices of articles stolen, take care that their prices are fixed having regard to the market rates prevailing at the material time and not with reference to the prices at which they were originally purchased. 

xiii.  If the informant knows or has seen the person by whom an offence reported 

was committed but his name and address are not known to him, do not fail to elicit  from  him,  a  description  of  the  latter’s  appearance,  which  should  be recorded along with the rest of the information. If the complainant is unable to give a list of property stolen at the outset (may be because he is not the victim of the theft or the person in the know of things or articles is away at the time) or its weight, make, design or distinguishing marks, do not fail to obtain it from the person concerned. There should be no delay whatsoever. 

xiv.  There  should  be  no  time-lag  between  the  receipt  of  informant  of  the 

commission of a cognizable offence and the recording of it. Whenever a report clearly  discloses  a  cognizable  offence,  do  not  embark  upon  a  preliminary enquiry which is illegal; but register the case at once. The First Information Report is the first information of an occurrence or transaction in point of time which reaches the authority competent to investigate or order an investigation. Obviously there cannot be more than one First Information Report in one case, however  many  the  victims  of  the  offence  may  be.  If  three  persons  are murdered in the course of an occurrence, preparation of three First Information Reports, one for the murder of each person, is irregular. 

48. **Cases Reported at Other Police Stations Outside the Jurisdiction** 
1. **Crime  of  Railway  Police  Reported  at  the  Crime  P.S.  :**  When  an offence committed within the railway police jurisdiction is reported to a local district Police Station or vice-versa, the Station which receives the report shall forthwith inform the Police Station having jurisdiction by telephone, wireless or telegram, which shall be followed up by the First Information  Report  transferring  the  case.  The  police  receiving  the information first should take up the investigation and continue it till the arrival of the police having jurisdiction. 
1. **Crime of one PS reported at other PS :** If a crime committed in the jurisdiction of another Police Station within the State is reported to the Station House Officer of a Police Station, a First Information Report should be issued and its substance entered in the Station House Diary. 
1. **Action by PS where crime is reported :** If the place of occurrence is near and is easily accessible from the Station House, the Station House Officer  will  at  once  proceed  to  the  spot,  take  up  investigation  and continue it till relieved by the police having jurisdiction. Simultaneously, action will be taken to send immediate intimation to the police having jurisdiction over the place. When the investigation is taken over by the latter, the First Information Report should be transferred. 
1. **When crime is reported at the nearest PS :** If the place of occurrence is  far  off,  immediate  intimation  should  be  sent  to  the  police  having jurisdiction over the place by the quickest possible means and the First Information  Report  transferred  to  them  simultaneously.  If  any  of  the persons, who are reasonably believed to have taken part in the offence, are found in the limits of the station where the offence is reported and if the  offence  alleged  against  them  is  of  a  serious  nature  and  there  is reasonable apprehension that they will abscond unless immediately taken into  custody,  they  should  be  arrested  and  produced  before  the  court having jurisdiction, intimation of their arrest being promptly sent to the Police Station within the jurisdiction of which the offence occurred. 
5. **When crime of  another  State  is  reported  :**  If a  report  relates  to  a cognizable  offence  that  was  committed  outside  the  State,  it  will  be entered in the Station House Diary and a certified copy of the entry will be given to the person who made the report and he will be referred to the Station House Officer within whose jurisdiction the offence took place. If any of the persons who are reasonable believed to have taken part in the commission of the offence are found in our State territory, and if the offence  alleged  against  them  is  of  a  serious  nature  and  there  is reasonable apprehension that they will abscond unless immediately taken into custody, they will be arrested and produced before the court having jurisdiction, intimation of their arrest being promptly sent to the Police Station within the jurisdiction of which the offence occurred. 

**Registration of Cases Where Jurisdiction is Doubtful** 

49. The police to whom a cognizable offence is first reported shall register the case and  take  up  the  investigation,  where  the  offence  has  been  committed  close  to  a boundary between stations and it is at first doubtful in which station limits it occurred. The station which should retain the crime should be subsequently settled. It is of little importance whether a crime committed close to a boundary line is registered in this or that station. What is necessary is that the police who first hear of it should take up the case and endeavour to detect it. 

    **Non-Cognizable Cases** 

50. Information  received  in  a  Police  Station  of  facts  which  constitute  a  non- cognizable case or any steps taken by the police on their own volition in a non- cognizable case will be entered in the Station House Diary. When a Police Officer finds it necessary to lay information before a Magistrate in a non-cognizable case, he may, under Clause (b) of Sub-Section (1) of Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, make a report to the Magistrate in writing of the facts which constitute such offence. If there are persistent complaints against a particular individual, which legally fall under the category of a non-cognizable offence, orders from the competent court to register the N.C. case may be obtained for investigation or action U/s 110 Cr.P.C. may be taken. 

    **First Information Report to Whom Sent** 

51. Once copy of the First Information Report will be retained in the Station and another will be forwarded without delay to the Magistrate having jurisdiction. Two copies will be sent to the Sub-Divisional Police Officer. The Sub-Divisional Police Officer will retain one copy and the Station House Diary and send the other copy of the First Information Report to the superintendent. In cases coming under Clause (b) of the proviso to Section 157 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the copy of the First Information Report should be sent to the Magistrate. 

    **Use of the First Information Report** 

52. The First Information Report is a very important document. It is the earliest record made of an alleged offence before there is time for its particulars to be forgotten or embellished. It can be used to corroborate or impeach the testimony of the person lodging it under Sections 145, 157 and 158 of the Indian Evidence Act. It can also be used under Clause (1) of Section 32 and illustrations (j) and (k) under Section 8 of the Indian Evidence Act. The necessity of drawing up this document with the utmost care and accuracy and with all available details need not, therefore, be overemphasized.

Chapter 49 

**Powers & Duties of Investigation** 

**Introduction** 

53. The  concepts  of  **Rule  of  Law**,  **Due  Process  of  Law**  and  **Natural  Justice** necessitate  that  all  crimes  should  be  registered  promptly  and  they  should  be investigated  impartially  and  competently.  Police  Station  is  the  chief  centre  of registration of crime and, accordingly, the staffs posted there have legal powers and prescribed  duties  to  investigate  the  crimes  and  cases.  Various  provisions  of  the Cr.P.C.  and  other  enactments  empower  police  to  register  crimes  and  take  up investigation for their legal and logical conclusion. The police, thus, are empowered to investigate offences both cognizable and non- cognizable ones. The cognizable offences  are  investigated  by  police  ip  so  facto  and  the  non-cognizable  ones  are investigated by them after obtaining permission from the appropriate authority. 

    **Power to Investigate Cognizable and non-cognizable Offences** 

54. The  officer  in-charge  of  a  police  station  is  empowered  to  investigate  every cognizable offence within the jurisdiction of that police station. Even if the police officer investigates a cognizable offence registered in his police station but beyond that jurisdiction, it cannot be questioned. Police officers, of and above the rank of Head Constable, posted at the police station are empowered to investigate cognizable cases on behalf of the SHO. 

    **Visit Scene of Crime Without Delay** 

55. After registration of the offence and sending FIR, the police officer has to proceed in person or he shall depute one of his subordinate officers to proceed to the spot for investigation and also for taking measures for discovery and arrest of the offender (section 157 Cr.P.C.). In case the offence is not of a serious nature, the police officer need not proceed in person or depute a subordinate officer to make investigation on the spot. (Section 157 Proviso (a) Cr.P.C.). If it appears to the police officer that there is  no  sufficient  ground  for  entering  on  investigation,  the  police  officer  need  not 

49

investigate such a case (Section 157 Proviso (b) Cr.P.C.). Where the police officer does not investigate the case as no sufficient ground for investigation is found, then the police officer shall prepare case diary and send final report. 

**Action When Instructions Received from the Court** 

56. The  Magistrate  may  under  section  156(3)  Cr.P.C.  order  the  police  officer  to investigate  any  cognizable  offence.  Further,  any  Magistrate  may  direct  an investigation to be made by a police officer on a private complaint received by him, of an  offence,  which  may  be  either  cognizable  or  non-cognizable. In  both the  cases referred for investigation either under section 156(3) or under section 202 Cr.P.C., the police officer has to necessarily register the crime in his police station and issue FIR immediately before taking up investigation. The police officer, whom the matter is referred, has to investigate that particular case and he cannot further endorse the crime for investigation to any other officer. After completing the investigation, the police officer in both the types of cases, has to submit his police report to the Magistrate under section 173 Cr.P.C. 

    **Further Investigation** 

57. Even after submitting final report under section 173 (2) Cr.P.C.,  the police officer is not precluded from collecting further evidence and is empowered to obtain the case file  from  the  court  for  further  investigation.  In  case  the  police  officer  finds  any relevant oral or documentary evidence even after filing charge sheet, the police officer has to forward the same to the Magistrate by way of further report, which is generally termed as additional information or additional charge sheet under section 173 (8) Cr.P.C. 

    **Investigation of non-cognizable Crime** 

58. If a police officer intends to investigate a non-cognizable offence, he can take the orders of the court and investigate, but he shall have no power to arrest without a warrant. 

    **Protection of Crime Scene** 

59. The investigating officer, on reaching the scene of crime should secure the crime 

51

scene  from  getting  disturbed  or  being  changed  by  any  persons,  intentionally  or unintentionally. The best physical evidence is normally found at the place where use of force against persons or property has taken place. Sometimes valuable pieces of evidence may be discarded or dropped or it may fall off accidentally or inadvertently at some distance from the scene of crime. Such spots also need proper protection. All such critical areas should be secured from intruders and stray animals or neighbours, friends, sympathizers, curious onlookers, newspaper reporters, press photographers and others who are not officially connected. The whole area should be cleared of all unauthorized persons in quickest possible time. The Press and other Media should be requested to keep beyond the barricaded/secured area. The following steps should be taken for protection of the scene of the crime: 

1. Cordon off the scene and surroundings, access and exit points effectively. 
1. Identify and persuade to retain the person who first informed the Police. Or, note his address, telephone number etc. 
1. Persons who are likely to provide information, investigation leads and other pertinent details should be segregated and examined for collecting all possible information,  Eye-witnesses  should  be  requested  and  allowed  to  stay  at earmarked place for examination. 
1. Physical  evidence  should  be  protected  from  pet  animals  like  dogs,  cats, rabbits, etc., and also rats, mice and birds, as also from adverse environmental influences such as wind, rain, sunlight, dust, smoke moisture, etc. 
1. No physical evidence should be disturbed from its original position without properly recording it. Jewellery, keys currency notes and other valuable items with evidentiary value, vulnerable to theft from the scene, should be removed and preserved after a seizure list is drafted. 
1. During the preliminary inspection of the crime scene care should be taken to ensure that nothing is inadvertently dropped such as cigarette butts, match sticks, empty packs of cigarettes, match boxes, ash, etc. and nothing is touched that may cause interference with the fingerprints, footprints, etc., and nothing is added such as hair etc. 
1. All  physical  evidence/traces  should  be  lifted  only  after  recording  and thoroughly searching the crime scene. Where traffic is to be restored or place required  for  use,  the  examination  of  scene  and  other  work  should  be completed as expeditiously as possible but with thoroughness. 
8. It should be borne in mind that evidence may not always be visible to eye. Even if visible, it may escape a non-observant eye or may not appear relevant. It is therefore necessary that the scene or places be subjected to close scrutiny both by experts and the Investigating staff. 

**Examination of the Scene of Offence** 

60. As soon as the information about an offence is reported, SHO shall, by quickest available means, proceed to the scene of offence after registering the FIR or making arrangements for the same depending on the nature of offence reported. It is important that  the  Investigating  Officer  and  his  team  proceeds  to  the  scene  of  crime  as expeditiously  as  possible  and  perform  their  respective  functions.  Particular  care should be taken for preservation of the scene, collection of all material and other evidence. Steps should also be taken for arrest of accused or pursuit of the accused if warranted  and  justified  for  the  investigation  of  the  case.  The  instructions  of  the Inspector  investigating  the  case  and  authorized  to  investigate  that  case,  shall  be complied with by all subordinates concerned. 

    **Search of Scene of Crime** 

61. The  search  of  the  scene  and  its  surroundings  should  be  made  patiently, methodically  and  in  a  definite  order  and  not  in  a  hurried  or  haphazard  way  lest valuable clues are missed or lost. Special attention should be paid to the floor, walls, ceiling, window sashes and all protuberances and edges, which are likely to bear traces. Nothing capable of bearing fingerprints or other trace should be ignored. The procedure as laid down below should be followed. 

    **First aid to the Injured** 

62. In the event of a person being dangerously wounded, the Police Officer who first arrives on the scene should render such first aid as is possible and necessary, without in any way disturbing the crime scene and take immediate steps to procure medical aid  or  send  the  wounded  person  without  loss  of  time  to  the  nearest  hospital  or dispensary for treatment. This should be done before entering on the formalities of the investigation etc., as the delay thereby incurred might cause serious risk to the life of the person so wounded. In nearly all cases, it should be possible for the Investigating Officer to note the position and nature of the injuries while arrangements are being made to procure medical aid or to send the injured person to a hospital. 

    **Preservation of Evidence** 

63. Simultaneous steps should be taken to preserve all valuable items or objects of evidentiary value at the scene. This is vital, as certain types of evidence is likely to get evaporated, decomposed, putrefied, degenerated or may undergo other chemical or biological changes with time and other environmental factors. Suitable containers like polythene or glass bottles, polythene bags, paper envelopes, aluminum foils, etc. and preservative substances should be  kept ready for proper preservation of evidence. Depending on the nature of evidence suitable preservatives should be added under expert  advice.  Examples:  Tissue  samples  should  be  preserved  in  20%  Dimethyl Sulphoxide saturated with Sodium Chloride for DNA analysis and Viscera should be preserved in saline etc. 

    **Recording of the Crime Scene** 

64. The police have a limited time and opportunity to make an in-depth study of the crime scene in an undisturbed state. No time should therefore be lost to record as accurately as possible the conditions existing when investigating officer arrives at the scene. Such a record will help the on-going investigations, reconstruction of the scene of crime and also presentation in the Court. The judiciary and defence counsel need convincing  evidence  to  substantiate  the  conditions  and  circumstances  reported prevailing  at  the  time  of  the  crime.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  make  a  visual presentation  that  shows  the  various  evidentiary  items,  witnesses  and  their interrelationship with the scene of crime. The methods of crime scene recording are Photography, Sketch, Observation notes, Videography and Audio tape recording. 

    **Sketching the Crime Scene** 

65. After the scene is photographed, it should be sketched, to provide measurements indicating the relative distance and position of the various items of evidence and their interrelationships. 
1. The  sketch  is  the  first  visual  record  of  the  condition  of  the  crime  scene.  It 

portrays  the  crime  scene  and  items  within  that  scene  that  are  of  interest  to  the investigation.  Sketches  properly  prepared  are  useful  during  the  interrogation  of witnesses, in making notes in the case diaries and in presenting information to the court. The sketch complements the photographs and notes made while observing the crime scene. The ultimate purpose of the crime scene sketch drawn as per set scale and plan, which is also known as crime scene planning, is to represent the facts of the crime with such clarity and precision that the crime itself may be reconstructed from the details. Courts rely to a great extent on sketch of the scene prepared. 

2. The Investigating Officer should make a rough sketch of the crime scene on the basis of his own observation but not what is stated to him by witnesses as such a sketch will be hit by 162 Cr.P.C. Even if the sketch contains some facts and narrations on the basis of his observation and some on the basis of what is stated by witnesses, such a sketch will also be inadmissible in the court, if admissible part cannot be separated from the inadmissible part. The sketch need not be drawn to scale, but should indicate accurate distances between objects dimensions of areas and relative directions. The items to be included in the sketch and number of copies should be determined at the outset. 
2. The rough sketch once drawn should not be altered. A smooth or fair sketch should be prepared on the basis of the rough sketch. The smooth sketch also known as crime scene plan drawing is prepared as per a convenient scale and plan from the details of rough sketch. Colour drawing will be helpful to distinguish various objects or the features of an object. 

   **Methods of Sketching** 

66. It is important that measurements shown on the sketch are as accurate as possible and are made and recorded uniformly. An erroneous measurement becomes difficult to explain and can introduce doubt in the minds of judges and others concerned not only regarding the authenticity of the crime scene processing, but also the competence of  investigator.  The  investigator  should  therefore  follow  a  standard  method  of sketching  depending  on  the  nature  and  background  of  a  case.  Standard  methods normally  adopted  for  sketching  are:  Coordinate  Method  or  Baseline  Method, Triangulation Method, Cross-projection Method. 

    66\.1 There are various signs and symbols useful for sketching, therefore, every IO should have an in-depth knowledge above them and should make use of them in preparing sketching of the spot for crime. 

    **Crime Scene Observation Notes** 

67. The officer  making the search  should  take  down  accurate  and detailed  notes, supported by accurate sketches drawn to scale, showing the whole layout and the exact places where the articles, etc. were found. It is not sufficient to say that an article was in a certain room or on a particular table, but its exact position must be noted and, if necessary, an enlarged sketch of that portion of the scene must be drawn. In  all-important  cases,  photographs,  video  graphs  and  where  possible  laser impressions should be taken of the scene and of the objects on which any useful clues are found. 

    67\.1 The successful investigation of a case rests on the ability of the investigating officer to gather maximum information from various sources in a limited time in order to use it subsequently. The police officer cannot easily and accurately recall past events for crime scene reconstruction or for court testimony after a lapse of time. Sometimes many seemingly unimportant details may prove to be of utmost utility as evidence and in the investigation process. Hence the investigating officer should enter all details, observations, data, statements as and when they occur in his observation notes and case diaries and should personally get these sketches prepared taking fullest assistance of his team, scientific personnel and other experts. He should see that the team members work efficiently, professionally and cohesively. 

    **Searching the Crime Scene for Physical Evidence** 

68. The primary purpose of inspecting the scene of crime is to search for any evidence left  behind  by  the  criminal  while  committing  the  crime.  Such  evidence  will  be invariable  present  in  all  scenes  of  crime  is  based  on  the  principle  of  exchange propounded by Prof. Locard in 1928, which says “ Whenever any two objects or materials, animate or inanimate, come into contact with each other, there is always transference of material from each object on to the other”. Such transference may be large or small, visible or invisible, detectable readily or difficult to detect, but such transference  does  occur.  It  is  therefore  the  primary  responsibility  of  Investigating Officers  to  search,  identify  and  collect  such  evidence  independently  or  with  the assistance of ‘CLUES’ Team. 
1. The crime scene is highly dynamic and is constantly undergoing change. It is also fragile, in the sense that the evidentiary value of the items it contains can be easily lost or downgraded. Usually there is only one opportunity to search the scene properly. Hence making a good overall survey of the scene is quite essential. 
1. A competent search of a crime scene requires a thorough understanding of crime, its nature, and extent of damage, people aggrieved, property lost or damaged and the manner in which the offence was committed. All items should be searched with equal care  and  concentration.  The  search  should  be  carried  out  carefully,  avoiding unnecessary disturbance of the scene. 
1. Based on the initial survey the investigator should first develop a hypothesis that will serve as the initial framework of the investigation. The hypothesis is simply a set of rational assumptions about how the crime was committed and the general sequence of acts that were involved. The hypothesis must be constantly reassessed in the light of each new fact or clue that is uncovered. There is often a tendency to arrive at unfounded  assumptions.  For  example,  if  the  Investigating  Officer  has  substantial evidence that a murder was committed where the body was discovered, he may be tempted to ignore a fact or clue that does not fit the framework of that idea. Such inflexibility  must always be avoided in the  crime scene search. The Investigating Officer must be willing to modify or change altogether his initial ideas concerning any aspect of perpetration of crime. It is only through such a process of reassessment that the full value of the Investigating Officers experience can be realized. 
1. By the time an initial survey of the scene is completed, the investigator should have noted the obvious items of evidence to be collected, and decide in what order he will collect evidence, what should be searched for, and how the tasks and areas have to be divided. 

   **Search Methods** 

69. Following are some of the important search methods adopted for investigation of crime scene. 
1. **Spiral Method:** The search is conducted following a spiral pattern working from outside to inside towards the centre or focal point (towards the body, safe or any other key feature) or vice versa, either clockwise or anti clockwise. It is an effective search pattern  for  single  person  search,  with  a  very  high  probability  of  locating  minute evidence like fingerprints, footprints, etc. Also, there is not much likelihood of the evidence being destroyed by the investigator’s movements.** 
1. **Radial Method:** In this method, the investigator works outward from the centre along the radial, and moves in circles of increasing circumference repeatedly. This method provides a double check on the searched area and is one of the best methods available for both indoor and outdoor searches. This method is preferred if more than one officer is conducing the search.** 
1. **Strip Method:** This is a sector search, useful both for indoors and outdoors, in which the crime scene is divided into segments and strips. The method works well if the  area  to  be  searched  is  square  or  rectangular  in  shape  with  clearly  marked boundaries. The search may be conducted by one or more officers depending on the size of the area and availability of officers.** 
1. **Grid Method:** Grid method is a slight modification of the strip method. This method is useful for small areas especially indoors. The area is divided into grids. In this method a single person can search the entire area by moving at right angles, and covering all the squares of the grid.** 
1. **Zone  Method:**  If  the  crime  scene  is  large  and  enough  personnel  are  not available, it is advisable to divide or sub divides the area into smaller zones and sub zones and uses this method of search. The method is particularly useful for searching in details the enclosed areas where items such as almirahs, safes, etc. have to be carefully  inspected,  and  for  cars  or  carriages  which  may  contain  minute  trace evidence, necessitating a through search of all nooks and corners.** 
70. **What to See and Collect From the Scene of Crime** 
1. The IO should search for body fluids on the scene of crime and collect blood, semen, saliva, sweat, tears, milk, urine, faecal matter. 
1. Body parts and body materials like skull, flesh, teeth, bones, nails, and broken bone pieces, viscera materials preserved during autopsy should also from part of collection of exhibits from scene of crime. 
1. Containers  of  powders,  chemicals,  drugs,  poisons,  narcotics,  inflammable liquids, miscellaneous substances including glass, plastic, tin, phials, bottles, cans, drums, gunny bags, and any other enclosed articles, if relevant should be collected. 
1. Documents  like  papers,  books,  cheques,  receipt,  counterfoils,  bills,  files, carbon papers, letter pads, writing materials viz., pens, ink, seals, stamps and their  impressions,  photocopies,  negative  and  positive  photo  etc.  are  also relevant and should be collected. 
1. Explosives  like  remnants  of  an  explosion,  springs,  wires,  timing  devices, chemicals, stones, cotton, paper, fillers, residual and unexploded portions of explosives, explosive devices should also be collected. 
1. Natural  or  synthetic  fibers  adhering  to  clothes,  upholstery,  seat  covers, drapery,  or  any  other  articles,  fingerprints-latent,  visible,  semi-visible, footprints-cast should also be collected from the crime spot. 
1. Burnt  remains,  inflammable  materials,  fire  remnants  and  burnt  remnants accelerants, other arson related articles, firearms-country made, factory made, live-cartridges,  empty  cartridge  cases,  bullets,  pellets,  wads,  gunpowder, discharge residues from hand, etc., where relevant should be collected. 

viii.  Glass fragments, pieces, sheets, bangles, articles, animal or human hair and impression metals serial numbers on metals-cast, engraved, etched or punched 

and other marks on metallic parts, filed, erased, stamped, etc. Impressions not included in any other category such as type  writer impressions, shoe prints, glove  impressions,  tooth  impressions,  fabric  impressions,  bite-mark impressions, lip impressions, etc. are also relevant from investigation point of view. 

ix.  Soil, dust, debris, mud, dirt, occupational dust in the form of stains, lumps, 

particles, powder, etc. and tools & implements, tool marks, cut marks, shear marks, punching marks, levering marks, file marks, chisel marks, drill marks, struck marks, depressed marks wood and vegetable matter and any fragments of wood, sawdust, or any vegetable matter on clothing shoes, tools, body etc., and materials like seeds, bark, leaves, etc., miscellaneous stains, impressions, prints, articles or other materials that is likely to link the crime or criminal with the victim or scene of crime should also be collected as part of evidenced collection by an IO. 

71. **Lifting, Packing and Forwarding Physical Evidence** 
1. Each  item  should  be  packed  separately  so  as  to  avoid  breakage,  loss  or contamination  in  transit.  Tweezers,  forceps  and  similar  tools  are  used  to collect and place traces and small items into containers. It is advisable to use rubber gloves to handle such physical evidence. An “evidence box” such as deal wood box, clean empty carton, cardboard boxes, etc. should be utilized for transporting the items of evidence. An evidence box with pegboard sides allows for tying or wiring small and medium sized objects in place. A series of drilled holes and appropriately sized clamps can serve the same purpose. 
1. Items of evidence that need comparative analysis for possible commonness of origin should be packed in separate containers to avoid any allegation of cross contamination.  Thoroughly  clean  and  dry  containers,  wrapping  paper, corrugated paper boxes and sealing tape are the basic safeguards for physical evidence in transport. No wet or solid materials or boxes should be used. 
1. Documentary evidence should be first placed in transparent envelopes without folding or bending, and then placed between two pieces of rigid cardboard and packed in a suitable cloth-lined envelope cover. 
4. Plastic pill bottles such as used medicine containers with lids are unbreakable and can be easily sealed with tape. They make excellent containers for hair, fibers, and other small trace evidence. They are ideal for spent bullets, empty cartridge  cases,  and  cartridges because they can  be packed with  absorbent cotton  to  minimize  movement.  Plastic  envelopes  and  bags  are  suitable  for packing  many  materials.  However  in  case  of  soil,  debris  or  clothing impregnated with bloodstains, this may result in bacterial action contaminating the blood sample, and should be avoided. 
4. If the stain is on a solid object that can be moved, such a  knife, crowbar, fire arm  or  any  other  weapon,  it  is  preferable  to  transport  the  whole  object, protecting the area of the stain or completely enclosing the object in a package (if it is small enough). If the stain is on clothing, the garments should be wrapped separately in paper, marked appropriately and packed. This is better than any other technique such as scraping for forwarding a movable sample of the stain for analysis. Garments and other clothing such as bed sheets, towels, tablecloths and similar evidence should be folded as small as possible and without  pressure.  The  specific  areas  of  such  fabric  which  contain  trace evidence should be folded in such a way as to protect such areas to avoid loss of such materials by falling off, peeling off, etc. It is preferable to send a soil- stained  or  mud-soaked  object  to  the  laboratory  rather  than  to  attempt  to remove and send the soil or mud as separate items. When such traces are picked up as individual items of evidence, it is vital that every precaution is taken  to  keep  the  evidence  in  separate  sealed  containers  to  avoid  any accidental loss or mixing in transit. 
4. Bed sheets, carpets, woolen materials from the scene of arson may be wrapped in metal foil and sealed in airtight containers. Smaller objects, such as paper and rags or solid samples should be sealed in the container in which they were found or places in airtight bottles or cans. This protects the fire accelerants and their residues from evaporation. Pills and other non-caustic substances should be  left  in  their  original  containers  for  transport  to  the  laboratory.  Such containers often contain useful information. The investigation officer should count  the  number  of  pills  and  capsules  or  accurately  determine  the  bulk quantity of fluids or powders and  should include such data in observation notes. Caustic or corrosive poisons should not be transported until their safe transit  is  ensured  by  suitable  means.  Appropriate  containers  such  as  glass bottles with a glass lid should be used for transporting substances such as acids. 
7. Food and edible substances should be placed in as many separate moisture proof bottles or containers as necessary to avoid any contamination. In case of suspected food poisoning the packages should be marked clearly as suspected or known samples of poison. Trace evidence, such as hair, fibers, etc. should be sealed in folded paper or places in clean, sealed envelopes. 

viii.  Adequate and appropriate samples should be collected. Bulky articles, samples 

in huge quantities e.g., cots, mattress, flooring stones, a drum of petrol or diesel oil, etc. or articles unconnected with the case should not be sent. Tag or mark  all  the  articles.  If  the  articles  can  be  enclosed,  put  a  mark  on  the container or the box. If special handling is required, it must be indicated and specific instructions provided on the packing itself, e.g., material is fragile or perishable. 

9. Indicate  any  special  priority  that  should  be  given  to  the  case.  Notify  the laboratory if the case is associated with any previous submission or evidence. Always obtain a signed receipt whenever evidence is transferred (chain of custody)  from  place  to  place  or  person  to  person.  All  evidence  should  be forwarded or received only in a sealed condition. Label, initial and seal all envelopes and the packages without fail. The seal should be legible and intact and all knots of stitching ropes must be sealed. Ensure prompt delivery of all items  of  interest  to  the  laboratory.  Record  all  the  procedures  adopted  for location, recording, lifting, packing and forwarding, in case diaries. 
9. Wherever feasible, it is advisable to bring the physical evidence in person and discuss the circumstances and history of the case so that the scientist will endeavour to bring out the right information from the scientific studies.

Chapter 63 

**Collection of Evidence** 

**Introduction** 

72. Investigation is a process of connecting the offender to the offence. This is a method by which various events are connected with one another. A chain of events is prepared which illustrates and elaborates various steps and activities involved in the commission of crime. Relating each of such activity with another one will require the support  of  evidence  of  one  nature  or  the  other.  The  job  of  investigation  and particularly that of collection of evidence is a serious, sensitive and complicated one. This  requires  use  of  utmost  intelligence,  competence,  presence  of  mind,  skills  of observation  along  with  utilization  of  various  tools  and  techniques  of  evidence collection. Collection of various types of evidences through scientific interrogation and with the help of scientific aids to investigation can absolve the police of all the allegations with regard to use of third degree methods. 

    **Nature of Evidence** 

73. The evidence to be collected during the course of investigation should be relevant and it should pertain to the facts in issue. Various provisions of Indian Evidence Act should be kept in mind, while collecting and recording evidences of various types. Only  that  evidence  should  be  collected,  which  is  admissible  in  the  court  of  law. Collection of inadmissible and irrelevant evidence is wastage of time and even dilutes the quality and status of investigation.  

    **Types of Evidence**  

74. The various types of evidences to be collected during investigation are following: 
1) Oral evidence 
1) Documentary  evidence 
1) Expert evidence 
1) Circumstantial evidence 
1) Other evidences 

63

1) **Oral evidence**: Oral evidence is the most frequently used mode of evidence collection by an Investigating Officer. Oral evidence must be in the form of direct evidence otherwise it will be inadmissible being hearsay. The Indian Evidence Act deals with the provisions of oral evidence in sections 59& 60. The oral evidence should be collected in accordance with the provisions of Cr.P.C. contained in chapter XII.** 

**Recording the Statements of the Witness** 

75. The investigating officer is empowered under Section 161 CrPC to examine orally any person (including a suspect) who is likely to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances  of  the  case.  He  may  reduce  to  writing  the  statement  of  each  such person, and when he does so, he shall make a separate record of each such person whose statement he records. The person so examined shall be bound to answer all questions relating to such case put to him, other than questions the answers to which would incriminate him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture. 
1. In order to examine a witness, the investigating officer should, as far as possible, contact him at his place, but may, if necessary, require the attendance before himself, of any person being in the limits of his own or adjoining police station. If a person so called intentionally fails to attend in spite of a written order served on him, he is liable to  be  prosecuted  under  section  174  IPC.  However,  under  proviso  to  section  160 Cr.P.C., no male person under the age 15 years or woman shall be required to attend as a witness at any place other than the place in which such male person or woman resides. 
1. When  a  police  officer  finds  it  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  any  police investigation to require any employee of any essential services, he shall give previous notice of the fact to the official concerned in order that the latter may take steps to replace the employee, and shall, at the same time, take all necessary measures to ensure that the object of the investigation is not thereby defeated. 

64

3. The statement of each witness should be recorded separately, in direct form and as far as possible in his own language and with the full version of what he states.  Section 173(5) of CrPC lays down a statutory obligation on the prosecution to furnish to the accused, copies of statements recorded under 161(3) of CrPC of all persons whom the prosecution proposes to examine as its witnesses.  

   **Recording Statements of the Accused** 

76. It is important and necessary for an investigating officer to record the statement of an accused person, more so, if it contains lengthy details. These details may require verification. The statement may sometimes disclose the line of defence and may also at times indicate sources from which  independent evidence  may be  available  and provide clues for further investigation. Verification of all details given by the accused is vital for investigation and should be diligently done and the facts thereof should be entered in case diary on day to day basis. 

    **Police Officers’ Visit to Jails for Collection of Evidence**  

77. Any police officer of a rank not lower than an Inspector shall be permitted to enter the jail at any time between unlocking in the morning and lock up in the evening. He will be permitted to interview the prisoners only on a letter of authority to the jail Superintendent  from  Superintendent  of  Police  or  superior  officers  or  District Magistrate. He may take other Police Officers and witnesses or informers with him for assistance. Police officers of lower rank than an Inspector in uniform are permitted to enter the jail for the purpose of recognizing old offenders. Any interview permitted as above shall take place in the presence of the jailer or other proper officer of the jail, who shall, if required to do so, keep at such a distance that he may not hear the conversation  that  takes  place.  The  Superintendent  of  the  Jail  shall,  produce  any prisoner in his charge whom the police are authorized to interview and shall afford every reasonable facility for this purpose. 

    **Dying Declaration**  

78. The statement given by a dying person is called dying declaration. Whether the statement is given expecting death or not, is not very relevant. Only those portions of the statement explaining the cause of person’s death or the circumstances resulting in 

    that person’s death are relevant. 

    **Recording Dying Declaration : Process & Precautions** 

79. The declaration may be recorded by any person. It should preferably be recorded by  a Magistrate, if  available.  If this  is not  practicable,  the doctor  or if  he is  not available the investigating officer may record it, in the presence of a witness. Even if the declaration is made to a police officer, it is admissible in evidence and its use is not  barred  by  section  162  of  the  Cr.P.C.  Even  if  it  has  been  made  orally  in  the presence of any person, it may be proved in court by the oral evidence of that person. The declaration becomes admissible, only if the declarant subsequently dies. If he survives, it will be useful, if made before a Magistrate or any one other than a police officer, to corroborate his oral evidence as a witness in court. If it was made before a police officer, it will be treated as a statement u/s 161 Cr.P.C. 
1. The declaration should be in the form of questions and answers and in the very words of the declarant. The signature of the declarant should invariably be taken on the  dying  declaration  wherever  possible.  If  the  declarant  is  an  illiterate  or  is incapacitated from signing for any reason, his thumb impression should be taken. When a declarant dies while giving a statement, the declaration is valid even though he does not put his signature or thumb impression. A note should be made in the dying declaration giving reasons why the signature of the declarant was not taken. 
1. When the declarant, being in a serious condition and unable to speak, makes signs by hand or head, the person recording the dying declaration must record the precise  nature  of  the  signs  which  the  declarant  made.  Before  taking  down  the declaration the persons recording the dying declaration should also ask the declarant whether he is mentally capable of making a declaration. He should obtain whenever possible  a  certificate  from  the  Medical  Officer  as  to  the  mental  condition  of  the declarant. Incomplete dying declarations are not by themselves inadmissible in law. Though a dying declaration is incomplete by reason of the deceased not being able to answer further questions in his condition  then, yet the statement to that  extent  is admissible provided it is proved he has given it consciously and the statement is not vague. An FIR can be recorded on the basis of dying declaration. 

   **Confessional Statement Made to the Police**  

80. Though confession made to police officers are inadmissible, under section 27 of Indian Evidence Act, if a statement is given by an accused to a police officer while in custody  and  that  statement  reveals  the  discovery  of  any  material  fact  and  in consequence of that statement if that material fact is discovered, that statement is admissible to the extent of such discovery. 

    **Recording the Confessional Statements** 

81. As soon as it appears to the investigating officer that an accused is likely to make a confession leading to the discovery of a fact, the investigating officer should secure the presence record the confessional statement himself, obtaining the signatures of the witnesses on the record. Stock witnesses or those who figure as panch witnesses in previous cases should not be taken. If it is not possible to secure the presence of witnesses, the investigating officer should himself record the confessional statement and afterwards when he is able to secure the presence of witnesses, he should read over the statement to the accused before the witnesses and, if it is agreed to by the accused  as  correct,  note  this  fact  on  the  record  and  obtain  the  signatures  of  the witnesses on it. The statement of the accused should be in the first person and in the very  words  of  the  accused;  a  separate  Panchanama  should  be  drawn  up  for  the discovery.  Giving  information  and  recovery  that  follows  it  are  two  different transactions and a separate Panchanama should be recorded for each of them. The information given by an accuse person should not be mixed up in the Panchanama drawn  up  for  the  recovery  made  in  consequence  of  such  information.  It  is  the information given by an accused person that determines his knowledge about that fact discovered and that has a direct bearing on his guilt. 
1. When one of several accused persons who have taken part in an act, for example, the burial of property at a certain place, offers to point out the place and the property is found in consequence, his confessional statement is relevant against him under section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. But if other accused persons suspected to have taken  part  in  burying  the  property  at  the  place  also  give  the  same  information subsequently the discovery cannot be attributed to second person. These confessional statements cannot be said to have led to the discovery of the property which has already been discovered and are not, therefore, relevant under that section. Though there is nothing objectionable in the investigating officer trying to see for his moral satisfaction  whether such persons  point  out the same  place as  the one previously shown by one of them, no attempt should be made to utilize that evidence against subsequent  persons.  If  two  or  more  accused  give  statements  under  section  27  of Evidence Act, simultaneously, it is inadmissible, as it cannot be attributed to any single person. Where the place of recovery is a public place accessible to all and sundry a discovery from such a place cannot entirely be attributed to the exclusive knowledge of the accused and therefore much reliance cannot be placed. 
2. The  accused  must  be  in  custody  of  Police  for  a  confession  to  come  under purview of  section  27  of Evidence  Act. Even  a  man  released  on  bail and  giving information leading to discovery of a fact can be deemed to be in Police custody within meaning of section 27. Arrest and custody are not synonymous. A person can be in custody without being formally arrested. 

   **Recording of Statements of Witnesses and Confessions of Accused by a Magistrate**  

82. In  important  cases,  witnesses  may  be  produced  before  Judicial  Magistrate; competent to record such statements under section 164 Cr.P.C. Such statements can be used to contradict the statements given by the same person during the course of enquiry or trial. If he retracts later he can be prosecuted for giving false evidence. 

    82\.1 If an accused person, on being arrested, expresses his willingness to make a confession, his confession may be got recorded under section 164 of CrPC by the competent Magistrate. As far as possible he must be taken before a magistrate other than the one who has jurisdiction to try the case. 

    **Tendering of Pardon**  

83. Conditional pardon can be tendered to an accomplice. Tendering of pardon can be given in the following cases 
1. All offences triable by sessions court 
1. Offences under Prevention of Corruption Act 
3. Offences which are punishable with 7 years or more 
1. Tender of pardon is given where the investigation has to establish the guilt of the accused by independent evidence. In such cases participant who played a minor role with offence is taken into confidence with a view to prove the case against the other accused.  The  accused  to  whom  the  tender  of  pardon  is  granted  is  an  accomplice witness. 
1. The pardon tendered to a person under section 306/307 of Cr.P.C., as already stated, is conditional that he should make a true and full disclosure of the whole of the circumstances  within  his  knowledge  relating  to  the  offence.  If  such  person  either willfully conceals anything essential or gives false evidence and thus does not comply with the conditions on which the pardon was tendered, he may be tried for the offence in respect of which the pardon was tendered later. 
1. During the course of investigation the chief judicial magistrate and during the course of enquiry or trial the presiding magistrate or judge are competent to grant pardon. 
2) **Documentary  evidence:**  The provisions contained in The Evidence Act, 1872 about private and public documents in the chapter 5 (section 61-100) should be kept in mind by every IO, while collecting documentary evidence with regard to the investigation conduct by them. In addition to that the instructions issued from time to time by the respective departments and the courts should also be taken note of by the IOs. 
1) **Directions to Obtain a Document or Thing:**  Whenever any Officer in-charge of a Police Station or Officer entrusted with the investigation of a case considers that the production  of  any  document  or  other  thing  is  necessary  for  the  purpose  of investigation, such Officer may issue a written requisition to the person in whose possession or power such document or thing is believed to be, requiring him to attend and produce it or cause to produce it at a time and place stated in the order (Section 91 of CrPC). If the statement of the person in whose possession the document or this is, to be recorded, he should be directed to appear in person and produce such document or  thing.  If  his  statement  is  unnecessary,  such  person  can  be  asked  to  cause  the document or thing produced on his behalf by any other person. If the document or thing is in the possession of an accused, an order for its production shall not be issued as it contravenes clause (iii) of Articles 20 of the Constitution of India. It should be seized after conducting a search of a place where such document or thing is kept. 
2) **Documents Required From Bankers:** According to section 4 of Bankers Books Evidence Act 1891 a certified copy (with prescribed certificate at the end) of any entry in a bankers book shall in all legal proceedings be received  as prima facie evidence of the  existence of such entry and shall be  admitted  as evidence of the matters, transactions and accounts therein. 
84. In cases where bank employees are involved in offences like misappropriation, forgery etc., or other bank frauds, financial or any other offences, the original records are required for examination by the hand writing expert. The relevant original records may be requisitioned by making out copies. The copies so made can be retained by them for banking purposes. Where the examination by hand writing expert is not needed,  and  the  records  are  required  only  for  investigation,  requisition  should  be confined to certified copies of entries which are admissible as prima facie evidence. 

    84\.1 Section 8 of the Bankers Book Evidence Act 1891 authorizes the officers not below the rank of Superintendent of Police specified by the Government under this section to requisition records or entries which are needed for investigation into any offence. This requisition should be in the prescribed form.  

3) **Articles/Documents to be Obtained from Postal or Telecom Departments :** If any document, letter, telegram, parcel or thing in the custody of Postal or Telegraph authorities is required, for the purpose of investigation, the Investigating Officer shall make an application to the District Magistrate or Chief Judicial Magistrate or Court of Session, and request for orders to the Postal or Telegraph authorities to deliver such document, letter, telegram, parcel or thing to the Investigating Officer (Section 92(1) of CrPC). The reference to Posts and Telegraphs authorities in this section may be interpreted to include Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and any other basic telephone (including WiLL) service provider or cellular operator whether Private or 

   Government. 

85. If  any  such  document,  parcel  or  thing,  in  the  possession  of  Postal  or  BSNL authorities in the opinion of Commissioner of Police or Superintendent of Police, is wanted for the purposes of investigation, he may require the concerned, to trace and detain such document, parcel or thing, pending the orders from the District Magistrate or  Chief  Judicial  Magistrate  as  mentioned  in  the  sub-order  (1)  (Section  92(2)  of CrPC). Instructions in the P & T Manual 1982, volume V regarding production of records in the custody of the post office are reproduced below: 

    85\.1 Records of a Post Office or mail office should be produced, and information available in them should be given on the written order of any Police Officer who is making an investigation under the CrPC, or of any Excise Officer empowered by a local government or administration to investigate offences under any Excise Act, but only those entries in the records should be disclosed which relate to the person or persons charged with the offence under investigation or which are relevant to that offence. In any other case, the official in-charge of the office should, without delay, refer for orders to the Head of the Circle, who will decide whether under Section 124 of the Indian Evidence Act, the information asked for should be withheld or not. 

4) **Inspection  of  Records  of  Courts  :**  Inspection  of  records  of  criminal  courts should be done by police in accordance with the instructions used in this contexts by the  respective  High  Court  of  the  State.  Instructions  in  this  regard  for  making applications for inspection of record and taking extracts should be strictly followed: 
4) **Inspection  and  Obtaining  of  Documents  from  Audit  Department  :** Investigating Police Officer will be given all facilities to inspect within the respective offices the original documents in the custody of audit offices. They will also have facilities to take out copies of such documents (including photostat copies). Even where  an  original  document  has  to  be  shown  to  a  witness  during  the  process  of investigation, it will be possible in many cases to have this carried out at the audit office. 
86. Where the Investigating Officer inspects the original documents, he shall sign and 

record the date of his perusal or inspection on the record so inspected or perused and thereafter  request  for  the  photo  copies.  The  photo  copies  can  be  used  in  the investigation. He shall also handover a letter to the head of the office to have the original documents in his custody under lock and seal. The expenses for taking out the photo copies will be met by the concerned office. 

86\.1 In a case where an investigating officer finds it necessary to have the original documents  in  the  possession  of  an  audit  office  examined  by  the  handwriting  or fingerprint expert, the Director General of Police will request the Accountant General to hand over the documents, in original, directly to the investigating officer, who may use them for identification purposes and also have them examined by experts. 

3) **Expert  evidence  :**  In  the  large  array  of  the  list  of  witnesses,  the  expert witnesses have a special significance. The expert opinion and there evidence is taken to be more objective, impartial and scientific as compared to the ordinary witnesses. The IO should have deep knowledge about the role, significance and relevance of the expert witnesses. Evidence and opinion of an expert are relevant as per the provisions of Indian Evidence Act (Section 45 to 51). These provisions deal with various facets of evidence by experts and admissibility thereof. 
87. An  IO  should  suitably  evaluate,  analyze  and  asses  as  to  which  part  of  his investigation would require help and assistance from an expert. At the scene of c rime there are a number of exhibits and pieces of evidence, which might be relevant for the investigation and which may require expert opinion. The IO should prepare a list to such objects and should collect those objects for scientific examination and obtaining expert opinion. An IO should have knowledge about various categories of experts and the subjects with which they deal. He should also know where to send the exhibits for examination and which institutions, organisations and forensic labs are there to render the requisite help. 
1. The experts who have given opinion on a particular matter should be cited in the list of witnesses with correct address and the issue on which they will tender their expert opinion. 
2. Extreme care and caution should be exercised in identifying, lifting, packing and forwarding the exhibits for experts' opinion because during any of the above stages if the exhibit is distorted, disturbed or destroyed, it may cause serious damage to the quality of evidence because either the expert opinion will not be available at all or if the one is available then on the ground of it being not fool proof, it may be rejected by the court of law. 
4) **Circumstantial evidence:** There are occasions when direct evidence is not available. In such a situation, in order to prove the case, an IO has to depend on the circumstantial  evidence.  Circumstantial  evidence  pertains  to  the  various  facts, situations and conditions, which would establish connection between the crime and the  criminal.  Such  facts,  conditions  and  situations  which  may  form  the  basis  of circumstantial evidences are dealt in the various provisions of the Indian Evidence Act.  
88. Any fact, condition, or situation, which is relevant with relation to the fact in issue,  that  is,  the  investigation  in  question,  may  form  part  of  the  circumstantial evidence. The facts, which are so connected with each other that they form part of the overall transactions of crime are relevant and may form part of the circumstantial evidence. Likewise the facts, which are the occasion, cause or effect with regard to the crime under investigation can also form part of the circumstantial evidence. In the same manner the facts, conditions and situation, which prove the motive, preparation and previous or subsequent conduct of the accused persons can also form part of the circumstantial evidence. An IO should have deep knowledge of the various provisions of evidence act, which deal with the various facts, conditions and situations which may become part of the circumstantial evidence. 
1. Collection of circumstantial evidence is a tough task and the IO has to work hard to collect such evidence. The evidence so collected should be corroborated by some support  evidence.  The  circumstantial  evidence  must  provide  a  complete  chain  of events  connecting  one  another  to  become  cogent,  succinct  and  reliable.  The connecting of the various facts, conditions and situations must provide a complete chain and no link of which must be missing. They must unequivocally point the guilt on  the  accused  so  as  to  exclude  any  point,  which  may  be  consistent  with  his innocence.  The  circumstantial  evidence  in  order  to  secure  conviction  must  be complete and conclusive in nature and prove the guilt of accused person beyond every reasonable shade of doubt. 
2. In order to make the circumstantial evidence valid foundation of conviction, the IO  should  collect  various  types  of  corroboratory  evidences,  which  may  be  oral, documentary, incidental, occasional or intentional. The circumstantial evidences may be corroborated with the help of expert opinion and scientific examination of various types of exhibits.  

   **Identification** 

89. Identification is one of the methods of collecting evidence. Witnesses see the individual or objects which are relevant for the investigation. In order to authentically connect such individuals and objects, the Investigation Officer prepares a profile on the basis of the statements of the witnesses. The witnesses later on are required to identity such individuals and objects to verify the authenticity of the version of the witnesses. This process is called identification and for conducting this process an identification parade is held often in the presence of a Magistrate. This process is relevant under Section 9 of the evidence Act. 

    **Procedure & Method of Holding Identification** 

90. When a witness says that he can identify accused persons or others connected with the case under investigation, the Investigating Officer shall record in the case diary in their descriptions, the extent of prevailing light at the time of the offence (daylight, moonlight, flashing of torches, burning kerosene, electric or gas lights, etc., details of opportunities of seeing the accused at the time of the offence; anything outstanding in the features or conduct of the accused which impressed him (identifier), distance from which he saw the accused, and the extent of time during which he saw the accused. 

    90\.1  The  accused  should  as  far  as  possible  be  mingled  with  persons  of  similar description,  status,  build  and  age  in  the  proportion  of  a  minimum  of  1:5  and  a maximum  of 1:10, and they  must  be  made  to take their positions along with the persons with whom they are mingled up in a line. They should not be made to stand together.  The  Magistrate  or  other  persons  conducting  the  parade  should  satisfy himself or themselves that no Police Officer takes part in the actual identification proceedings that witnesses are kept out of view from the premises where the parade is taking place and that it is not possible to communicate with them by signals or other communications. Witnesses should then be called in, one by one, and they should be asked to go round the persons assembled for the parade and point out the accused, if any. If the identification is held by a Magistrate the proceedings should be drawn up and signed by him. If the identification is held by panchayatdars in the absence of a magistrate, the proceedings should be drawn up by one of the Panchayatdars and attested  by  all  of  them.  Statements  made  by  the  identifying  witnesses  to  the panchayatdars at the time of the identification should be recorded in the proceedings. Even if a witness makes a mistake, it should be recorded. In short, the proceedings must contain a complete record of all that takes place in the identification parade. After the identification by one witness is over, care should be taken to see that the witness  does  not  mingle  or  communicate  with  the  other  witnesses  for  whom identification parade is yet to be conducted or other outside persons and the whole parade will be reshuffled and the accused made to take different positions. If the accused  so  desire,  they  should  be  allowed  to  change  their  dress  also.  The  same procedure will be repeated in the case of other witnesses also. Any well-founded objection by any accused during the identification parade should be recorded. After the completion of the identification parade and the drawing up of the proceedings, a certificate  must  be  appended  signed  by  the  Magistrate  or  the  panchayatdars conducting the parade. 

    **Salient Points of Identification** 

91. The  following  are  the  salient  points  to  be  borne  in  mind  by  Police  Officers arranging identification parades:- 
1) Warn the accused person that he will be put up for a parade and he could keep himself veiled; 
1) Secure the services of a Magistrate for holding an identification parade ; If this is not possible, secure two or more respectable and independent persons of the locality  to  hold  the  parade  ;  do  not  select  persons  already  known  to  the identifying witnesses to stand along with the suspects in the parade ; arrange for the identification parade immediately an accused is arrested. There should 

   be no delay. 

3) when one accused is arrested in a case in which more than one accused is required to be identified, do not postpone the parade of the arrested accused, till the others are secured. As each accused is arrested, go on arranging for the parade. 
3) Other persons participating in the parade should be of the same build, age, dress and appearance as the suspects; 
3) Maintain a minimum proportion of 1:5 and a maximum proportion of 1:10; distribute  the  accused  among  others,  they  should  not  be  made  to  stand together; 
3) keep the accused out of the view of the witnesses and take precautions to prevent their being seen by others from the time of their arrest, if they are to be put up for identification parade subsequently; 
3) Shuffle the persons in the parade after identification by each witness and make a record of having done so in the proceedings; 
3) In respect of each accused, a separate identification parade should be held; 
3) When  several  accused  persons  are  required  to  be  identified,  the  innocent persons, mixed up with one accused at one parade, should not be mixed up with another accused at a second parade. They should be changed, with every change of an accused person. 

**Identification by Photographs** 

92. Photographs of certain classes of criminals are maintained in the District Crime Record Bureau. Photographs exist also for dossier criminals. Witnesses may be shown the photographs and asked to identify. In cases where criminals are identified through photographs, a regular identification parade should also be held after the apprehension of the accused. When identification is sought to be made through photographs, single and  individual  photographs  should  not  be  shown  to  witnesses.  Photographs  of  as many persons as possible, among which should be the suspect's photograph, should be shown to the witness, who should be asked to pick out from among them the suspect's photograph, if it is there. 

    **Identification Through Finger and Foot Impressions** 

93. Identification can also be established from finger impressions left on the scene. Finger  impressions  found  on  the  scene  can  be  developed  and  tested  to  find  out whether they tally with those of the suspected persons or not. Foot impressions left on the scene can also be lifted and compared later with foot impressions of the suspects. 

    **Previous Conviction or Acquittal** 

94. As prescribed by Section 298 of the Cr.P.C., a previous acquittal can be proved by a certified extract from the court record and the previous conviction either by such extract or by a certificate from the jailor or the warrant of commitment together with evidence in each of such cases, as, to the identity of the accused persons with the person so acquitted or convicted. 

    **Identification of Property** 

95. During  investigations  it  may  sometimes  be  necessary  to  conduct  test identifications of articles involved in criminal cases. A test identification of properties which  do  not  bear  any  special  marks  of  identifications  is  of  immense  value  in enhancing the credibility of identification evidence in court; and a test identification of properties which bear definite marks of identification is not necessary. 
1. When a witness states that he can identify properties connected with a case under investigation.  Their  descriptions  and  other  marks  of  identification  along  with  the circumstances under which he had previously seen them on several occasions during which he had previously handled them, and any other relevant circumstances should be recorded by the IO. 
1. Make a clear record in the case diary and the search list of the places from which and how the stolen property was recovered. Evidence that the stolen property was buried  under  ground  or  was  concealed  in  the  walls  or  secreted  in  back  yards  or houses, etc., will help to establish the receiver's belief as to the nature of the property. 

   **Case Diary** 

96. Section  172  CrPC  requires  that  every  Police  Officer  making  an  investigation 

should enter day by day his proceedings in a diary, setting forth the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he began and closed his investigation, the place  or  places  visited  by  him  and  a  statement  of  the  circumstances  ascertained through his investigation. 

**Nature & Importance of Case Diary** 

97. Case diary is a confidential and privileged document. Though the accused has no right to look into it, the court may look into the diary. However if the police officer refreshes  his  memory  while  giving  evidence  by  looking  into  the  case  diary,  the accused is entitled to look into that portion as referred by the police officer and may use it for contradicting the police officer. 

    97\.1 The Investigating Officer and his superiors shall ensure the physical safety of the case diary as well as its contents. Any leakage of the contents to any person other than authorized  by  law  leads  to  undesirable  consequences  and  will  be  detrimental  to prosecution. They should not permit access to any unauthorized person particularly the accused or their agents or their counsel. The officer who has custody of case diaries either as an IO or a superior officer supervising investigation should ensure that it is handed over to their successors in office. The access to the case diaries is limited only to the IO, the superior officers and the concerned legal officers who are in charge at a given time and not to others. 

    **Contents of Case Diary** 

98. Every case diary should contain the following information. 
1. date and hour of taking action; 
1. date of report of the case;*                       
1. name of the complainant or informant; 
1. names of accused known, if any; 
1. property lost; 
1. property recovered; 
1. date and last page of the previous case diary, if the case diary is not the very first one; 
1. name of the deceased, if any, and 
9. names of witnesses examined. 

**The First Case Diary** 

99. The first Case Diary should commence with a brief summary of the FIR, the time of receipt of the complaint, delay if any, in starting for the scene, the time of departure for and arrival at the scene,' and description and plan of the In cases where there is no scene as such like in Financial Crimes, the records and places where such records or data  recording,  storage  or  retrieval  systems  are  located,  the  method  of  crime  as reflected at such places, objects, computers, documents etc. and the plan or sketch or diagram representing the crime scene so to say may be described or drawn up as is possible. 

    **Details & Description** 

    100\. A statement of circumstances ascertained through the investigation at the place or places visited by the investigating officer, and the date and hour of closing the investigation  shall  be  noted.  Every  step  taken  by  the  10  shall  be  mentioned  as concisely as possible.  Every clue obtained, even if at the time it appears likely to be of no value, houses searched with reasons for the search and the names of witnesses to the search, property recovered, its description and place where it was found, arrests, information obtained which is likely to prove of value, and methods adopted by the suspects/accused  are  among  the  things  to  be  mentioned  in  the  case  diary.  -The substance of the statements of witnesses shall find place in the case diary.    

    100\.1 The case diary shall be written incorporating the investigation done on each day.  Statements  of  witnesses  should  be  reduced  to  writing  on  the  spot  in  the prescribed Form. If it is not possible they should be written in the IO's note book, and transcribed in the prescribed form as soon as he returns to the Station House. If, for any unavoidable reason, notes had to be taken on separate sheets of paper, these should not be destroyed after the case diary is written but preserved in the case file. 

    **Copies of Case Diary** 

    101\. Case diaries and statement of witnesses will be duplicated by carbon process, or by photocopiers. The original is retained in the station and the other sent to the SDPO concerned who shall deal with the case diaries in the manner prescribed. In cases investigated by Sub-Inspector who is also SHO of Police Station the case diaries will be  directly  forwarded  to  SDPO  concerned  who  in  turn  shall  after  scrutiny  and necessary instructions to the I.O., dispose them off as prescribed. 

    **The Concluding Case Diary** 

    102\. In the concluding diary, the investigating officer shall record a summary of the reasons which have guided his final decision in the case. If he considers that there is no case, his reasons will, of course, be more detailed and fuller than the one sent up for trial. 

    **Role & Responsibility of the Subsequent IOs** 

    103\. Succeeding investigating officer should the investigation made by the previous I.O. and to re-examine all the important witnesses already examined, to ascertain the facts and circumstances of the case. But, as regards the recording of their statements, law does not require the investigating officer to reduce such statements into writing. The Andhra Pradesh High Court has observed that, "Courts will not expect a Police Officer to stultify his investigation for the purpose of making such a record". It is, therefore, enough if the second investigating officer, in case he is the superior to the first  investigating  officer,  re-examines  witnesses  with  reference  to  their  previous statements already on record and certifies to their correctness. If any additional facts are spoken to by any witness, the second investigating officer will have to record those facts and note such other facts as may be necessary in clarification of the facts and  omissions  in  the  statement  already  recorded.  However,  in  a  case  where  the statement recorded by the first investigating officer is devoid of essential details or has omissions or defects, it is advisable for the second investigating officer to record the statement once again in detail. In such case both the statements will remain on record and supplied to the accused. 

    **Action When Case in Transferred to CID** 

    104\. In a case taken up by the CID, the I.O. of the CID is expected to verify and re- investigate the entire case and not merely to continue the investigation already done by the local Police Officer. To that end, it is necessary that he should not only re- examine  the  witnesses  but  also  record  their  statements  in  full.  The  fact  that  the recording of such statements may lead to possibility of contradictions and deviations in  the  statements  of  witnesses  and  may  cause  inconvenience  to  the  police  in furnishing copies to the accused cannot be valid and lawful ground for evading it. 

    **Case Diary in Inquest Case** 

    105\. In inquiries under section 174 CrPC relating to suicide and accidental deaths, statements of witnesses examined during the inquest will be recorded separately and attached  to  the  inquest  report.  However,  in  a  case  where  it  has  not  been  clearly established that it is a suicidal or accidental death, though the panchayatdars at the inquest  have  so  opined,  a  case  diary  should  be  written  discussing  the  evidence gathered and available during the inquest and the grounds for treating the case as an accidental or suicidal death not warranting investigation. When a Head Constable holds an inquest, the Sub-Inspector should subsequently verify the investigation, and the result of such verification should be embodied by him in a case diary. A case diary should  also  be  written  summarizing  the  result  of  the  postmortem  examination,  if conducted.  

    **Progress of Trial to be Recorded** 

    106\. In order to report the progress of trials in courts, case diaries should be written, reporting details of all hearings and adjournments, the witnesses examined at each hearing, how each of them fared, gist of arguments of defence and prosecution, Court observations or orders and other matters of interest, if any, particularly with reference to their statements before police earlier and other material particulars including name and designation of the Police Officer who attended the Court. 

    **Use of Case Diary for Seeking Remands etc** 

    107\. Remands should be applied for along with case diary. Sub- Section (1) of Section 167 of CrPC requires a copy of the case diary to be sent when remand is sought. The investigating officer should, therefore, prepare an additional copy of the case diary, when he is aware that he will have to send a prisoner for remand. The statements recorded under section 161 Cr.PC till then should also be enclosed to the case diary.  107.1 Case diary forms should be used for applying to Magistrates for warrants of arrest or search, for proclamations and other orders connected with investigation and for forwarding search lists provided these communications refer to registered cases. Ordinarily, the memorandum form will be used. 

    107\.2 Case diaries should also be written in cases, referred by a Magistrate to the police for investigation under section 155, 156 or 202 of CrPC.

Chapter 83 

**Arrest, Custody, Bail, Remand and Search** 

**Introduction** 

108\. After registration of FIR, visit to the scene of crime and collection of evidence, when an IO arrives at the conclusion that reasonable suspicion exits against the suspect that he has committed a crime and for completing the investigation his arrest is necessary, he may arrest him in accordance with the law. After arrest the accused person is taken under the police custody, and if the crime is bailable, he may be released on bail, and if the crime is non- bailable, the IO would approach the relevant court for providing police or judicial custody as per the requirement of the investigation. Arrest, Custody, Bail and Remand are therefore, essential ingredients of police investigation. 

**Power of Arrest** 

109\. Chapter 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedures, 1973 deals with various provisions of arrest (Section 41 to 60). Police officers derive their powers of arrest without warrant from sections 41, 42, 43(2), 60, 129 and 151 CrPC. Provisions of sections 46, 47, 49, 50, 51, 56, 57, 167 and 169 of CrPC deal with various procedures and precautions during and after arrest.  

109\.1 The police under the above sections affect arrests without warrant; however, there are provisions when they are required to arrest persons with warrants. The arrest warrants are issued by the courts and there is no discretion available with the police for executing such warrants and these should be executed in accordance with the directions of the court. 

**Arrest Warrants** 

110\. The warrants are either bailable or non-bailable. In respect of bailable warrants the arrestee should be released on bail when he offers the required security and in respect on non-bailable warrants the police officer has no discretion, and the person must be produced before the concerned Court. Prompt execution of warrant is one of the foremost duties of the police and should receive high priority. The warrant must be executed by the officer to whom 

83

it is endorsed. If that officer wants warrant to be executed by his subordinate officer he must make endorsement by name accordingly. 

**Arrest Precautions** 

111\. Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution lay down that no one shall be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law and that arrested persons are entitled to know the grounds of their arrest and a right to consult and be defended by an Advocate  of  their  choice  and  that  every  arrested  person  should  be  produced  before  a Magistrate within 24 hours. Arrest takes away the liberty of a person and should therefore be affected in strictly compliance of the law. Wherever it is warranted, it should be promptly carried out, but arrest, is not to be effected just because a police officer has the power. No accurate account of all circumstances under which arrest without warrant can be made or should not  be  made can be detailed. A police officer should exercise due prudence and exercise his discretion in this regard in a judicious manner. 

**Conditions of Arrest** 

112\. To infuse confidence among the terror stricken victims, particularly in grave offences like murder, dacoity, robbery, burglary, rape, organized crime, terrorist offences etc. and, in case where the accused is likely to abscond and evade the process of law, arrest should be affected. If the accused is given to violent behaviour and is likely to commit further offences unless his movements are brought under restraint, and if the accused is a habitual offender and unless kept in custody, he is likely to continue to commit similar offences, he should be arrested. Where it is necessary that his presence is required for the purpose of investigation, he should be arrested. Likewise, where accused is likely to tamper or intimidate or cause physical hurt to witnesses or destroy other evidence, he should be arrested. 

113\. **Cautions, Precautions & Guidelines for Arrest** 

1. Police Officer making an arrest should record the reasons for making the arrest to justify it, if required. The Police Constables and Head Constables who make the arrest should submit a report detailing the circumstances of the arrest to the SHO or  IO  concerned  who  should  incorporate  the  contents  of  such  reports  in  the General Diary, Case Diary etc. All Police Constables, Head Constables and Sub- Inspectors working in the field and empowered under law to exercise the powers 

85

of  arrest  without  warrant,  should  exercise  their  powers  with  prudence  and  be accountable for the arrest made in the discharge of their assigned tasks and duties. 

2. In the light of these instructions, the action of Police Officers of all ranks in arresting persons, if not necessary and not arresting when it is necessary, will amount to misconduct, and may call for suitable disciplinary action. No arrest should be made in a routine manner simply because the law empowers the police officer  to  do  so.  The  existence  of  the  power  to  arrest  is  one  thing,  while justification for the exercise of power of arrest is quite another. The police officer may  without  arresting,  keep  a  watch  on  a  person  and  then  arrest  him,  if subsequent events justify such action. No restraint can lawfully be exercised over a person so long as he is not arrested. The arrest should be avoided if the intention is only to verify the suspicion of involvement against a person. A police officer may under section 160 CrPC issue a notice to the suspected person to attend the police station and interrogate him. He should not be detained for long and more than necessary. 
2. When  a  police  officer  proceeds  to  arrest  a  person  and  cannot  identify  him personally, he should secure the services of a person who knows the person to be arrested  and  should  also  provide  himself,  if  available,  with  a  photograph,  a descriptive role and the marks of identification of that person. He should be sure of the identity of the person to be arrested. 
2. The police officer should be in uniform with his name and number if any, on the pocket, besides carrying his identity card, or, if in plain clothes, carry his identity card and should disclose his identity. He should arm himself with such firearms and  accessories  required  for  his  defence,  if  the  circumstances  demand  such  a precaution. 
2. Police parties engaged on anti-dacoity, terrorist operations or similar duties which are likely to lead to arrests of dangerous persons, should carry handcuffs and leading chains to secure the arrestees, to prevent their escape or violence. 
2. The person to be arrested with or without warrant should be informed of the 

   grounds for making the arrest. The arrest should be affected without unnecessary violence or publicity. 

7. Section 46 of the CrPC lays down that the police officer making the arrest of a persons shall do so by actually touching or confining the body of the person to be arrested, unless there is submission to the custody by word or action. When a person  is  to  be  apprehended  and  if  he  resists  by  force  or  tries  to  evade,  the arresting  police  officer  may  use  necessary  force  to  arrest  him  except  causing death. But if the accused to be arrested is involved in an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, the force can be even to the extent of causing death depending upon the circumstances. 

VIII.  When a person to be arrested is concealing himself in a closed place, the police 

officer has every right to enter such places even by force to affect the arrest. He can even arrest every one who obstructs him from discharging his duty. However, he must behave decently with women inmates. Police officer can exercise the right of private defence of his body and others while resisting arrest. 

114\. **Supreme Court Observations on Arrests** 

1. The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their  designations.  The  particulars  of  all  such  police  personnel  who  handle interrogation of the arrestee must be recorded in a register. 
1. The Police Officer carrying out the arrest of a person shall prepare a memo of arrest at the time of arrest and such memo shall be attested by at least one witness, who may be either member of the family of the arrestee or respectable person of the locality where the arrest is made. It shall also be countersigned by the arrestee and contain the time and date of arrest. 
1. A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a police station or interrogation centre or other lock-up, shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare informed, as soon as practicable, that he has been arrested and is being detained at the particular place, unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself 

   such a friend or a relative of the arrestee. 

4. The time, place of arrest and venue of custody of an arrestee must be notified by the police where the next friend or relative of the arrestee lives outside the district or town through the Legal Aid Organization in the District and the police station of the area concerned telegraphically within a period of 8 to 12 hours after the arrest. 
4. The person arrested must be made aware of this right to have someone informed of his arrest or detention as soon as he is put under arrest or is detained. An entry must be made in the diary at the place of detention regarding the arrest of the person which shall also disclose the name of the next friend of the person who has been informed of the arrest and the names and particulars of the Police Officials in whose custody the arrestee is. 
4. The arrestee should, where he so requests, be also examined at the time of his arrest  about  major  or  minor  injuries,  if  any,  present  on  his/her  body.  The "Inspection Memo" must be signed both by the arrestee and the Police Officer affecting the arrest and its copy provided to the arrestee. 
4. The arrestee should be subjected to medical examination every 48 hours during his detention in custody by a doctor from the panel of approved doctors appointed by Director, Health Services of the concerned State or Union Territory, Director, Health Services should prepare such a panel for all Mandals and Districts as well. 

VIII.  Copies of all the documents including the  memo of arrest, referred to above, 

should be sent to the jurisdictional Magistrate for his record. The arrestee may be permitted  to  meet  his  lawyer  during  interrogation,  though  not  throughout  the interrogation. 

IX.  A police control room should be provided at all district and State headquarters, where information regarding the arrest and the place of custody of the arrestee 

shall  be  communicated  by  the  officer  causing  the  arrest,  within  12  hours  of effecting the arrest and it should be displayed on a conspicuous police board at the 

police control room. 

**Search of the Arrested Person**  

115\. Whenever a person is arrested and not released on bail by a police officer a thorough search of his clothes and belongings should be made before putting him in lockup. Articles found upon him other than necessary wearing apparel should be placed in safe custody and if any articles are seized from his person, a receipt showing the articles taken possession by the Police Officer shall be given to such person. The personal articles of the person should be kept  in  safe  custody  in  the  Property  Room  (Malkhana)  and  entries  made  in  concerned registers.  If  there  are  any  incriminating  articles  or  objects  or  materials,  which  might  be necessary for investigation, they should be separated and the procedure for recording and despatch  of  case  property  to  courts  should  be  followed.  The  other  property  should  be returned to him or his nearest kith or kin when he is remanded to custody. 

**Arrest of Female** 

116\. Whenever it is necessary to cause a female to be searched, the search shall be made by a Woman Police Officer or another female with strict regard to decency. The officer or other person making any arrest, shall seize from the arrested person any offensive weapons, which he has on his person and shall deliver all weapons so taken to the court or officer before which or whom he is produced. 

117\. **Treatment of the Arrested Persons** 

1. Whenever any person is arrested by a Police Officer or by a private person and is brought to the police station, the SHO shall examine the body of the arrested person and note whether he has any injuries over his body. If any, injuries are observed irrespective of their nature, he should forward the said person to the nearest Medical Officer of the Government Civil Hospital or other Hospitals of local bodies authorized for medico-legal work, for treatment and injury certificate. The Medical Officer should be requested to specify the age of each injury. 
1. When any person with injuries in a serious condition or a drunken  person in uncontrollable condition, who is unable to take care of himself, is brought to the police  station,  the  SHO  shall  immediately  forward  such  persons(s)  to  the Government  Hospital.  Any  delay  may  cause  death,  in  which  case  the  police officer in-charge of the police station will be held responsible. The statement of the injured person should be recorded in the hospital and further action taken. 
3. When an arrestee demands examination of his body, which will afford evidence to disprove the charge leveled against him and establish his innocence or evidence of an offence against his own body, the Police Officer should forward him to the Medical Officer of the Government Civil Hospital for the examination and injury certificate. Such a certificate shall be forwarded to the Magistrate concerned. 

**Right of Arrested Persons** 

118\.  The  arrested  persons  have  certain  rights  with  which  the  Police  Officers  should  be familiar.  These  are  important  from  the  human  rights  angle  also  besides  being  statutory provisions and should be respected. The important rights are - 

1. Right to be informed of the grounds of arrest 
1. Right to be produced before a Magistrate without unnecessary delay and within 24 hours 
1. Right to consult a legal practitioner or any one of his choice 
1. Right to be informed of right to bail 
1. Right of a person without means to free legal aid and to be informed about it 
1. Right to be examined by a Medical Officer 

119\. **Arrest of Children and Women** 

1. The  Juvenile  Justice  (Care  and  Protection  of  Children)  Act  2000  prohibits lodging of children in police lock-ups or being brought to police stations after arrest.  Alternatives  are  provided  for  lodging  the  delinquent  juveniles.  The procedure prescribed therein should be observed in respect of juveniles. 
1. While making arrest of a woman submission to custody should be presumed unless circumstances to the contrary exist. There should be no occasion for a male Police Officer to touch her person. It is therefore advisable whenever it is proposed to arrest a female, women police should be employed. 
3. Arrest of women should as far as possible during night times be avoided unless it is inevitable. When it is not possible to secure the services of women Police Officers, an officer of the rank of ASI or above should effect the arrests. Bail may be granted where  the offence for which  the  arrest  is  made is not of a serious  nature.  The  SHO  may  take  exercise  his  discretion  in  non-bailable offences to release a woman arrestee on bail. 
3. Whenever a woman is arrested, the services of women Police Officers should be utilized  for  guarding  and  escorting  her.  If  women  Police  Officers  are  not available in the Police Station, one of the relations of the arrested woman, of her choice can be permitted to remain with her. When interrogation of the arrested woman is done by a male Police Officer the relation or woman Police Officer should  be  present.  If  a  Woman  Police  Officer  herself  is  conducting  the interrogation, the presence of a woman relative may not be necessary. 

120\. **Arrest of Persons of Specific Categories**  

1. **Arrest of Ordnance Factory Employees:** Arrest of an employee of an ordnance factory owned or sponsored by the Government should be notified immediately to the General Manager or the officer in-charge of the factory.** 
1. **Arrest of Central or State Government or Quasi-Government Employees:** When a Central government employee of any department or a State Government employee or an employee of a quasi-Government Organization is to be arrested by the police, wherever it is practicable and desirable, prior intimation  of the  arrest of such  an employee should be sent to his immediate superior officer or the officer in-charge of the  institution  or  department.  The  prior  intimation  must  be  treated  as  secret. Whenever prior intimation is given by telephone it should be followed by a written intimation mentioning the time and date of such conversation. The fact of telephoning should be recorded in the General Diary if intimation is by SHO. If the intimation is by a superior officer he should make a record of it in the Telephone Register. After the arrest by the police, intimation of the arrest along with a copy of arrest memo should be sent immediately to the highest officer of the department available in the district to which the person belongs with a copy to the immediate superior officer (of the person) if, for any reason, prior intimation could not be given; and this should be followed by a detailed report of the offence committed together with an indication as to whether the arrested person is being released on bail or personal bond, by the police.** 
3. **Arrest  of  Public  Servants  on  Operational  Duty:**  When  a  public  servant  on operational duty of a department of the Central or State Government, e.g., railway staff like station masters, assistant station masters, guards, drivers and train control staff; or electricity department staff like sub-station attendants, is to be arrested, prior intimation should be given to his immediate superior, as a rule, to facilitate them to make alternate arrangements. Departure from the procedure should be made only in very exceptional cases and even in such cases; intimation should be given to the superior  officer  immediately  after  the  arrest  of  the  public  servant.  "However,  in respect of the operational staff of the trains, prior intimation should invariably be given  to  the  Railway  Divisional  Authorities  or  where  this  is  not  possible,  to  the superior available at the Station where the arrest is made".** 
3. **Arrest of Employees of Foreign Diplomatic/Consular Missions:** In the event of the arrest of an Indian employee of a Foreign Diplomatic/Consular Mission, intimation should immediately be given to the Foreign Diplomatic/Consular Mission through the Government.** 
3. **Arrest of Foreigners:** When a foreigner is arrested, reports as required in Order 349 of Chapter 16 on Foreigners should be sent.** 
3. **Arrest of Military Employees:** The arrest of personnel of Armed Forces including Navy and Air Force charged with the commission of an offence should be intimated to  the  Commanding  Officer  to  enable  him  to  take  appropriate  measures  for  the defence of the personnel.** 
1. The persons so arrested shall be dealt with in all respects like any other person in  the  matter  of  the  investigation  of  the  offence  in  respect  of  which  he  is arrested. The question as to whether he is to be tried by a Court Martial or a Court  functioning  under  the  CrPC  is  a  matter  for  decision  between  the Commanding Officer and the Magistrate before whom he is brought by the police, in accordance with the rules made by the Government of India under 

   Section 475 CrPC. 

2. When any investigation, search or arrest is contemplated within military lines (quarters), the Police Officers concerned should be in uniform and if in plain clothes should carry identity cards and, so far as circumstances permit, prior notice should be given confidentially to the Officer Commanding, Adjutant or Orderly Officer concerned. 
7. **Arrest of Indian Army Reservists:** When a reservist of the Indian Army is arrested and remanded on a criminal charge, the facts of arrest and remand will at once be reported to the DGP with information to the Army unit to which the person arrested belongs. When the case is completed, its result and, in the event of conviction, the period spent in jail by the accused while  under  trial,  prior  to  conviction  and  the  sentence  awarded  shall  be  reported.  The information  so  reported  will  be  communicated  by  the  DGP  to  the  appropriate  Army authority. 
7. **Arrest of Members of State and Union Legislatures:**  
1. All the rights that any arrested person has, are available to Members of Legislature and Parliament whenever they are arrested. All guidelines and instructions contained in this chapter apply to them. The procedure contained  in  this  should  be  scrupulously  observed  whenever  any Member of Legislative Assembly/Council or Parliament is arrested by the police. 
1. Whenever a member of a State or the Union Legislature is arrested, he should immediately be produced before the Magistrate concerned and there should be absolutely no delay. The police will send information of the arrest through a telegram or Radio Message, to the Speaker of the  Lok  Sabha  or  the  Legislative  Assembly,  as  the  case  may  be. Failure to send immediate intimation to the presiding officer of the Legislature concerned will constitute a breach of the privilege of the House. 
1. If a member of the Union or a State Legislature is concerned in an unimportant case, he need not be arrested, except when it is really necessary.  When  arrest  is  made  in  a  bailable  offence,  he  member should  be  immediately  released  on  his  own  recognizance.  If  the offence  is  a  non-bailable  one,  the  member  should  be  immediately produced  before  the  Magistrate.  In  any  case  the  fact  of  arrest  and release on bail or remand should be intimated to the Speaker. Though the instructions are that the Magistrate should send intimation to the Presiding Officer of the Legislature concerned, prompt reporting by police is necessary. 
4. A report of the arrest (whether released on bail either by the Police or by the Magistrate) should be sent by the SP/CP in whose jurisdiction the arrest is effected to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly or the Chairman of the Legislative Council, as the case may be, by telegram or  Radiogram  or  automex  or  fax  with  a  copy  of  confirmation dispatched simultaneously by speed post along with a copy of Arrest Memo. 
4. The message should contain the information as furnished in the arrest memo sent to Magistrate  and relatives. Thereafter a detailed report should  be  sent  to  the  Presiding  Officers  concerned  containing  the following  information:  the  place  of  custodian  detention  of  the Member, when a Member, who is under detention or is undergoing, a sentence of imprisonment is transferred from one jail to another, the change in the place of detention or imprisonment and when a member is released from jail on any ground e.g., on bail pending appeal or on the sentence being set aside on appeal or on the remission of sentence by Government on completing the sentence or on the termination of preventive detention, such release. 
4. The SP/CP also should simultaneously report the arrest by telegram or radiogram  to  the  DGP,  to  enable  him  to  report  it  forthwith  to  the Government and the Secretary to the Legislature. The copies of such reports should also be sent to the superior police officers. 

121\. **Direction to Subordinates to Arrest** 

1. A Police Officer in-charge of a police station, or any Police Officer making an investigation, under Section 55 of the CrPC depute any officer subordinate to him to arrest the person. He should give an order in writing specifying the person to be arrested and the offence or cause for which the arrest is to be made. The officer so authorized shall notify to the person to be arrested, the substance of the order and, if so required by such person, shall show him the order. This section, however, does not take away the statutory power vested in all Police Officers by Section 41 of the CrPC. 
1. A Head Constable in-charge of an outpost or a beat area or check post, without the intervention of the SHO, may take action in offences under special and local enactments, which empower the Head Constable to take action. When a private person arrests any person who commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence in his view, he shall be taken to the nearest police station immediately and such person be re-arrested by the police. 

122\. **Police Custody** 

1. A person who is arrested and not released on bail shall be detained in a secure area of the Police Station earmarked for such purposes, under constant watch. A prisoner whom the SHO considers being dangerous and is likely to escape should be kept in the lock-up under continuous and effective watch. This should be done only  making  a  thorough  search  and  necessary  entries  should  be  made  in  the prisoners search register and guard or watch sentry relief book.  
1. A person called to a police station for questioning in order to verify his complicity in any offence shall not be kept in lock-up, without effecting arrest. Arrested persons who are known to be goondas, rowdies, dangerous criminals, members of organized gangs, terrorist groups, those likely o escape and charged in serious offences of murder, rape, kidnapping for ransom etc. should be kept in the lock up rooms. 
3. A person in police custody shall not be permitted to leave the lock-up after sun set, except in special and emergent circumstances (and that too with adequate escort) which shall be recorded in the general diary and the Sentry Relief Book. 
3. A person in police custody prior to remand is entitled to see his relatives and an Advocate. He should not, however, be allowed to talk to members of the public. If the arrested person desires that one of his relatives may be permitted to remain with him, his request should be considered unless there are compelling security reasons. If the arrested person for health reasons prefers to get his food from his residence, he can be permitted, but the person bringing food to the police station should be made to eat samples of all the food items before serving to the person in custody.  However,  in  normal  course,  the  arrested  persons  should  be  fed  at Government's cost as per the rates approved from time to time. 
3. Whenever any punitive action is taken or contemplated against a foreigner, he should  be  provided  with  facilities,  if  he  so  desires,  to  communicate  over  the telephone or by a telegram or latter, with the Counsel, High Commissioner or other representative of his country, as the case may be. 

123\. **Treatment of Persons in Custody** 

1. Once a person is in custody of the police, the responsibility for his life and safety will be totally on the police. The physical and psychological condition of every person  in  custody  is  a  major  factor  that  should  determine  the  precautions, facilities and arrangements required to be made. The other factors such as the nature of the offence in which he is involved, the investigation required to be done,  the  antecedents,  age,  sex,  ignorance  and  vulnerability  are  all  vital  and crucial.  While  every  case  has  its  peculiar  features  and  circumstances,  certain important stipulations should be observed. 
1. The first requirement is physical safety of the person in custody. This includes safety  from  injury  and  death,  whether  self  inflicted  or  otherwise.  As  the psychological state of each individual cannot be accurately gauged, it is necessary to realize that the general mental state of a person arrested and brought to police station  would  be  fear,  shock,  trauma,  sense  of  guilt  and  shame  etc.  Suicidal tendencies  therefore  develop.  Hence  the  place  where  he  is  lodged  should  not contain  anything  including  his  apparel  or  belongings  that  afford  him  any opportunity to attempt or commit suicide. 
3. There should be a watch on the person all the time, at least by one policeman. The room or place where he is kept should be such as to afford a full view to the Police Officer posted to watch him and also to the Station Writer, HC or Duty officer. The place of work of these two should be so adjusted  as to  afford a complete view of the lock up rooms. 
3. Wherever any attempt or suspicious about the movements or action comes to notice,  the  lock  up  room  should  be  opened  and  searched.  There  should  be effective  intervention  to  prevent  attempt  at  suicide  and  injuries.  The  whole episode should be recorded in the station General Diary, Sentry Relief Book and the person should be sent for Medical examination with a report. The Magistrate and all other authorities to which the Form report is made should also be informed in writing. 
3. Since the person is in custody, sometimes even self-inflicted injuries or suicides can  be  interpreted  as  those  caused  by  police,  hence  effective  and  timely intervention, contemporaneous recording of events, reporting to all concerned of such attempts by persons in custody are important. 
3. No Police Officer or IO shall use any force or cause any physical injury during interrogation of the person in custody. If such injuries are caused and result in death of the person, the Police Officers concerned will be liable for prosecution for homicide and the burden of proof of their innocence lies on them. 
3. Two  blankets  and  two  dhurries  for  rural  stations  and  four  blankets  and  four dhurries for town police stations having lock-ups should be supplied for the use of persons in police custody for each lock-up. These should be always kept clean, washed and dried. These articles will be treated as station property and the officer in-charge of the station or Outpost will be responsible for their issue to such of the prisoners who do not provide themselves with their own bedding. 

VIII.  The police lock-up, if it contains a prisoner or prisoners shall be unlocked at 

daybreak. The bedding of the prisoners, shall be at once brought outside, well shaken and left for some hours in the sun. In lock-ups where toilet facilities are not provided, the night vessels, if any used, shall be removed and toilets shall be thoroughly cleaned. Wherever toilets are provided they should also be thoroughly cleaned. 

9. The persons in custody shall be taken to the latrine and shall be allowed to wash. They shall be given food daily at 10.00 am or earlier if necessary before he is taken to Court and again at 5 pm. If prisoners are not brought to the station before the hours prescribed for meals they should be given food as soon as possible after they are confined in the lock up rooms. They should be fed at government cost if food is not brought by their relatives. 
9. Prisoners are not to be subjected to needless  indignity or harsh treatment. At district Headquarters or at places where police vehicles are available, prisoners should be conveyed from jail to court and back in the police vehicles. Prisoners whose confessions are to be recorded should be taken to the Court from the jail in a police van, when available, escorted by warders as a special case. In places where there is no police van, but where public transport is available, under-trial prisoners should be conveyed by normal bus service, irrespective of the distance to be travelled, provided that the number of prisoners to be taken at a time is small and can be controlled easily and provided that their presence in the bus does not cause inconvenience or annoyance to members of the public using it. In places where none of the above modes of conveyance are available, under-trial prisoners who are persons of good social position, accustomed to use a conveyance, may be allowed a conveyance, provided their safe custody is not jeopardized. The same rule should be followed in the case of prisoners who are certified by a Medical Officer to be physically unfit to walk. In other cases, prisoners should go on foot except in the cases noted below, but no prisoner should be compelled to march on foot for long distances. 
9. When  convicted  prisoners  are  escorted  along  with  under-trial  prisoners,  the 

   former may be conveyed by the transport Bus in which the latter are conveyed, irrespective of the distance travelled, in order to avoid the inconvenience and expense of providing a separate escort for them. 

12. Whenever women prisoners have to be escorted by road, they should be provided with a conveyance, where the distance to be travelled by them exceeds 2 km. Conveyance may also be provided for shorter distances for reasons of health or custom or for other valid reason. Failure to make such provision would cause undue hardship to them. 

**Use of Handcuffs** 

124\. The use of handcuffs or leg chains should be avoided and if at all, it should be resorted to strictly in accordance with the law mandated in judgment of the Supreme Court in Prem Shankar Shukla vs. Delhi Administration (1980, 3 SCC 526) and Citizen for Democracy vs State of Assam (1995, 3 SCC 743). The points to be observed in this regard are as follows: 

1. When an accused is in Court during the trial, he must be held to be in the custody of the  Court.  If  an  accused  is  so  dangerous  that  it  is  necessary  to  handcuff  him, representation should be  made to the Court,  and the Court will issue appropriate instructions in the matter. Accused persons while in Court during trial should not be handcuffed except with the permission of the Court. 
1. Under-trial prisoners and other accused persons shall not be handcuffed and chained without  specific  permission  of  the  court  and  only  if  there  is  a  reasonable apprehension, either due to heinous nature of the crimes with which they are charged or  from  their  character  or  behaviour  that  such  persons  will  use  violence  or  will attempt to escape or that an attempt will be made to rescue them. The same principle shall be applied to convicts proceeding in public while in police custody. Whenever non-convicted accused persons are handcuffed with court's permission, the fact and the reasons for it shall be stated in the Station House general diary, the sentry relief book, and in the remand diary forwarded to the Magistrate. 
1. The prisoners either convicte4d or under trial and confined in a sub-jail shall not be handcuffed, whenever they are taken out in the precincts of the sub-jail for food or other necessities, rather the entire guard including the guard commander shall be present. If there are more number of prisoners, the guard in-charge should inform the 

   officer in-charge of the police station to send two or three constables to assist the sub- jail guard during the period when the prisoners are taken out. The officer in-charge of police station shall provided extra manpower as required by the guard in-charge. 

4. Whenever, it is considered necessary to handcuff certain prisoners confined in sub- jai, while they are taken out, the written orders of the Magistrate should be obtained and the permission granted by him should be maintained in a book to be kept by the guard officer. 
4. With regard to a refractory, violent or dangerous prisoner, the officer in-charge of the sub-jail guard or the senior Police officer present may control him only by utilizing more personnel and by such force as may be necessary, while rushing a messenger to the concerned court or Magistrate for permission to handcuff him. 
4. Under-trial-prisoners  or  accused  persons  in  Hospital  should  not  be  handcuffed without permission of the court. In no case should prisoners or accused persons who are aged and bed ridden in hospital or women prisoners, juvenile prisoners or civil prisoners be handcuffed or fettered. If necessary extra guard should be provided. The restriction on use of handcuffs is not to place any embargo on use of minimum force to control a violent prisoner. 

125\. **Sick Prisoners** 

1. When a prisoner, who arrives at a Police station, is seriously ill, medical aid should be provided. When not available, the prisoner should be sent by the quickest  conveyance  available,  if  his  condition  admits  of  it,  to  the  nearest station where medical assistance can be procured. 
1. Prisoners attacked by cholera or other infectious or communicable disease in a police station should be removed from the lock-up and places in an airy part of the station and all possible treatment provided. 
1. Whenever sick prisoners are brought from rural police stations to district head- quarters hospitals and admitted as in-patients, the fact should be reported to the Superintendent of Police of the district or Dy. Superintendent of Police or the Inspector of the District Reserve Police in whose area the hospital is located, and an armed guard will be provided from the Reserve. 
4. In  large  hospitals  in  cities,  where  prisoner's  wards  are  provided,  the  guard provided for the prisoner's ward should take charge of such prisoners brought from the districts. The guard in-charge of the district headquarters hospital or city hospital, should find out from the resident Medical Officer or in-charge Medical  Officer  of  the  ward  about  the  probable  date  of  discharge  of  the prisoner. The information about date of discharge should be furnished to the police station or district from which the prisoner was admitted to the hospital, so that the concerned police shall take back the prisoner. 
4. Most of the District Headquarters Hospitals/General Hospitals are provided with prisoners' ward. If such provision is not available the SP or the CP should take up the matter with the concerned authority and ensure that the prisoner's ward as per the norms is provided. The prisoner irrespective of his status should be lodged in the prisoners' ward as to ensure their safety and enable the police to guard them effectively. This would also prevent inconvenience to other patients. Arrangements are to be made for their treatment in the prisoner's ward itself except where it is necessary to shift them in emergencies either to an operation theatre or to an Intensive Care Unit. The governments have issued instructions in this regard to the concerned authorities. 
4. In case of death of a prisoner admitted to the hospital, the officer in-charge of the police station in whose jurisdiction the hospital is situated shall register a case  under  section  174  CrPC  and,  inform  the  Executive  Magistrate  to  hold inquest and make such other enquiries. Finally the dead body will be handed over to the relations through concerned police. 

**Confinement of Other Department Prisoners in Lockup** 

126\.  When  any  prisoner  arrested  and  escorted  by  officers  of  other  units  such  as  police stations & CID, Exercise, Customs etc., are brought for confinement in the police station lock-up, a written requisition shall be given to the officer in-charge of the police station and the latter shall keep such prisoners in the lock-ups. The Officers of the other units will keep their subordinates besides police station guard. If there are no prisoners in the concerned police station lock-up, the key of the lock-up shall be given to the officers of other branches or units or departments and they will be responsible for the prisoners' safe custody. In the lock-up if there are already prisoners of the concerned police station, the key shall remain with the in-charge of the guard. In all circumstances, the duty of supplying the prisoners with food and guarding them, when taken outside the lock-up, shall lie with the outside officers. 

**Escape from Custody** 

127\. In all cases of escape of prisoners from police custody including those from jails where police guards are posted, a report by Automax. Fax, Radio or Telephone shall immediately be sent by the Superintendent of Police or the Commissioner of Police as the case may be to the Director General of Police, Addl. DGsP L&O Intelligence, CID, and Zonal IG/DIGP who will communicate the information immediately to the government. The radio or telephonic report  shall  immediately  be  followed  by  a  detailed  report  in  triplicate  furnishing  the circumstances  under  which  the  person  escaped,  whether  the  escape  of  the  prisoner  was accidental or as a result of collusion of negligence, the action taken to apprehend him, the person  or  persons  responsible  for  the  escape,  the  exact  quantum  of  responsibility  to  be attached  to  the  Police  personnel  involved  and  the  action  taken  against  them,  and  other relevant particulars. These reports should be properly drafted and neatly typed with proper care. 

**Bail** 

128\. Bail broadly means surety security for release of a person who is arrested. A person is released  on  bail  with  or  without  sureties.  Offences  are  of  two  types  as  far  as  bail  is concerned, bailable and non-bailable. When a person is arrested for a bailable offence, he is entitled to be released on bail either by the SHO or by court. In cases of arrests for non- bailable offences, bail is discretion. 

1) **Bail in Bailable offences:** The SHO is competent to release a person on bail when arrested  for  bailable  offences.  If  the  arresting  police  officer  is  not  the  SHO,  the arrestee shall be produced before the SHO with a written report for release on bail. If the accused jumps bail in a bailable offence and when he is arrested again, it should be treated as a non-bailable offence. In case bail is given by SHO in bailable offence the bond should be taken in the Form. The detailed addresses of the sureties have to be noted there in. 
2) **Bail in Non-Bailable Offences:** When a person is arrested for a non-bailable offence ordinarily he shall be produced before the court but the SHO may release on bail in exceptional cases covered by section 437(1) and (2) CrPC after obtaining express permission by SP/DCP/CP concerned. 

**Grounds for Opposing Bail** 

129\.  Important  points  for  opposing  bail  in  non-bailable  offences  are:  likelihood  of absconding,  possibility of  tampering  with evidence,  intimidation and  threat  to  witnesses, likelihood of repeating the offence, nature of the offender and the seriousness of the offence, likelihood of breach of peace and tranquility in the locality, likelihood of retaliations by the victims' party. 

129\.1 **Bailable Warrants:** When a person is arrested under a bailable warrant, he should not be compelled to come to the police station to give bail. He should be given bail at the place of arrest if he offers security. 

129\.2 **Anticipatory Bail:** When a person apprehends arrest for a non-bailable offence on a reasonable suspicion, he may apply to the High Court or Sessions court to give a direction to release him on bail in case he is arrested. In such cases the court gives notice to the P.P. with sufficient information to enable him to argue the case. In case the order is given in favour of the petitioner, the direction will be that he should be released on bail in case he is arrested on taking security as specified in that order. This clearly shows that the police officers are competent to arrest even if one gets such order. The only facility is that he should be released on bail in case of arrest without producing him in court. The court may be requested to impose appropriation conditions in case an order is given in his favour. 

130\. **Remand of Arrested Accused** 

1. When a person is arrested during the course of investigation and if the investigation is not  completed  within  24  hours,  the  officer  in  charge  of  the  police  station  shall forward the accused to the nearest judicial magistrate along with a remand report enclosed by the case diary written till that date. 
1. The accused will be remanded only when the investigation discloses some offence 

   against him so far and further investigation is needed for completion. A remand at a time will be for a maximum period of 15 days. However in cases under A.P. Control of Organized Crimes Act 2001 and Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002, the police remand may be for 30 days. Further remand if necessary is only by the jurisdictional magistrate. The police can seek remand for 60 days in ordinary cases where offences are  punishable  with  imprisonment  for  less  than  10  years  and  90  days  in  cases punishable with death or life imprisonment or with imprisonment for not less than 10 years. If the charge sheet is not filed within that period, the accused shall be entitled for a bail even in a serious case like murder. 

3. No  accused  shall  be  remanded  to  judicial  custody  unless  he  is  produced  before Magistrate. But in Andhra Pradesh an accused can be remanded even from jail by means of video conferencing. An accused can be remanded separately for each and every case committed under different transactions. Remands always shall be given by the Judicial Magistrate, but in the absence of any Judicial Magistrate an executive magistrate on whom the powers of judicial Magistrate are conferred can give remand, if the arrested person is produced before him. In such cases the remand can be only for a maximum period of 7 days by executive magistrate. Beyond this, remand can be given only by the competent Judicial Magistrate. 

**Searches** 

131\. Searches, personal and house, are important tools of investigation. Police Officers are empowered to conduct these searches as per the various provisions under CrPC. Personal search  is conducted immediately after  a person is  arrested and  taken under the custody. House search can be conducted prior to arrest or after the arrest as per the needs and demands of the investigation. 

132\. **Powers of Search** 

1. An  Officer  in  charge  of  a  Police  Station  or  an  Investigation  Officer,  having reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  anything  necessary  for  the  purpose  of investigation, may be found in any place within the limits of the Police Station, and that such thing cannot in his opinion be otherwise obtained without undue delay, may search the place under Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Before making the  search,  the  Police  Officer  must  record  in  writing  the  grounds  of  his  belief, specifying therein the thing for which the search is made. If the Investigating Officer is unable to conduct the search in person, he may require any officer subordinate Police Officer so deputed should be given an order in writing specifying the place where and the thing for which the search is to be made. Copies of records made above should be sent to the nearest Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence. 
2. When a search has to be conduced in the jurisdiction of another station, whether in the same or a different district, an officer in charge of a Police Station making an investigation  may  require  under  Sub-Section  (1)  of  Section  166  of  the  Code  of Criminal Procedure, the officer in charge of the former station to make a search or cause  search  to  be  made.  But,  where  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the  delay occasioned  by  such  a  procedure  might  result  in  evidence  being  concealed  or destroyed, the Investigating Officer may, under Sub-Section (3) of Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, make the search himself or cause the search to be made, in which case, he shall forthwith send a notice of the search together with a copy of the list prepared under Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the Officer in  charge  of  the  Police  Station,  within  the  limits  of  which  the  place  searched  is situated and to the nearest Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence. When a search is made under Section 165 or Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a copy of the list prepared under Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, signed by the witnesses, shall be delivered to the owner or occupier of the place searched. 
2. Under Section 165(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Station House Officer or Investigating Officer must, if practicable, perform the actual searching in person. If incapacitated from so doing he must comply with Sub-section (3) of that section and deliver to his subordinate the prescribed order in writing. A verbal order given on the spot will not fulfill the requirements of the section. 

133\. **Procedure for Search** 

1. At least two respectable witnesses of the locality shall be asked to be present at a search. The search shall be conducted in their presence and the list of things seized should be signed by the witnesses. The occupant of the place or his representative shall be allowed to be present during the search and a copy of the search list signed by the witnesses shall be given to him. 
2. When any person is searched under sub-section (3) of Section 100 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a copy of the list of things taken possession of shall be given to him. Before the commencement of the search, the person of the Police Officer and the witnesses  should  be  searched,  so  that  there  may  not  be  suspicion  of  something extraneous being planted in the house or the place to be searched. 
2. The law does not require a search under the Code of Criminal Procedure to be made only by daylight, but, normally, daylight should be awaited. If information is received after dusk necessitating the immediate search of a house and if it is apprehended that delay till daybreak might result in evidence being concealed or destroyed, the house should be sealed and guarded and if that is not possible, search should be conducted during the night itself. Before entering the premises to be searched, the exterior of the place shall be inspected to see whether facilities exist for introducing property from outside.  Search  must  be  systematic  and  thorough.  Women  should  be  allowed  to withdraw. Indiscriminate search and damage to property should be avoided. 
2. A search list shall be prepared on the completion of the search in quadruplicate, all the copies being signed by the Police Officer making the search and the witnesses to the search. One copy will be handed over to the owner or occupant of the house, the second copy should be sent to the Magistrate and the third copy should be sent with the case diary to the superior officer to whom case diaries are sent. The fourth copy will form the station record. If blank paper has unavoidably to be used, four copies of the list should be made and dealt with as above affixing the fourth copy to search list book, on return to the station. 

**Precautions for Conducting Searches** 

134\. The following precautions should be taken while conducting searches: 

1. Searches, as far as possible be conducted during daytime, except when circumstances otherwise warrant. Before proceeding to conduct a search, prepare a record indicating reasonable  grounds for making the search,  the place  to be searched, the thing or things for which search is to be made, and why such thing or things cannot otherwise 

   be obtained without undue delay. 

2. Search report and one copy of the record so prepared without delay should be sent to the Magistrate and duplicate copy to be submitted to the senior officer, and the third copy be kept in case diary file. The Panchas and witnesses should be respectable and inhabitants of the locality. When it is not practicable to do so and Panchas have to be selected from  any other place,  make a record of the reason in case  diary. Avoid calling the same Panchas to witness several searches. If, for any reasons, the same Panchas have witnessed more than one search, make a record of those reasons in case diary. When the Panchas are selected, serve an order on each of them requesting them to attend and witness the search. 
2. Commence the search only after securing the presence of witnesses and explaining to them  the  object  of  the  search  and  the  articles  for  which  it  is  made.  Before commencing the search, call out the inmates and have their bodies searched observing due formalities. Before commencing the search, request the occupants of the place to be searched to be present and to attend the search. If the occupant is not willing or fails to be present to attend the search, make a record of it in the search list and the case diary. 
2. If there is reasonably apprehension that the delay caused in securing the attendance of the  occupant  frustrates  the  very  object  of  search,  proceed  with  the  search  in  the presence of whosoever present on his behalf and record the reasons for so proceeding, in case diary and search list. Get yourself and the witnesses searched in the presence of the owner or occupier or any other adult male member of the house, if available, before the commencement of the search. When once the search is started, do not allow persons inside the house to go out or those outside to come in. conduct the search in each room in the actual presence of the witnesses. 
2. After  the  search  is  completed  and  the  thing  or  things  for  which  the  search  was conducted and any other incriminating articles are fond or brought out, get yourself and the witnesses again searched and make a record of it in the search list. Mention clearly in the search list every item of property seized, the exact place where it was found and how and by what means it was taken out from that place. Note in the search list the descriptive particulars and identification marks of the incriminating articles recovered. Make out the search list on the spot even if no articles re seized. Record the number of the house and other particulars including the occupant's name, parentage and occupation. 
6. Recover documents, if any, to prove the ownership or occupancy of the person from the place where incriminating articles are recovered and record such recovery in the search list. Sign with date on all pages of all copies of the search list and obtain the signatures of the witnesses on all pages of all the copies. Give under acknowledgment a copy of the search list immediately to the occupant of the house searched. 
6. On completion of the proceedings send without delay one copy of the search list to the jurisdictional Magistrate, attach another copy to the case diary of the relevant date to be sent to your officer, file the third copy in your case diary file, and attach the fourth copy to the final report to be sent to the court. 

**Custody of Property** 

135\.  According  to  Section  541  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  when  any  property regarding which any offence appears to have been committed or which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence is produced before any criminal court during any inquiry or trial, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the proper custody of such property pending the conclusion of the inquiry or trial. If the property is subject to speedy or natural decay or if it is otherwise expedient so to do, the court may, after recording such evidence as it thinks necessary, order it to be sold or otherwise disposed of. Thus, this section provides for the interim custody of property. The Magistrate, as a rule, will provide a place for the safe custody of property seized in cases. If however, he refuses to take charge of it, the police must be responsible for it. Such property should be kept under lock and key in a lock-up cell or in an iron clamped box in custody of the treasury or sub-jail guard. 

**Disposal of Property if Court Declines to Take Possession** 

136\. When a court or a Magistrate refuses to receive any property from the police or to pass any order under Section 452 of the Code of Criminal Procedure regarding its disposal on the ground  that  he  does  not  believe  that  an  offence  has  been  committed  in  regard  to  it  the 

following instructions should be followed: 

1. The police shall retain the property sufficiently long to enable the parties to appeal to a higher court against the court's or Magistrate's procedure. 
1. If no application for revision is made nor order passed on revision, the police shall return the property to the person from whom it was taken, unless there is obvious objection to so doing. 
1. In doubtful cases the police may apply for an order under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the Magistrate having jurisdiction. 
1. When no order can be obtained from a Magistrate or court an the ownership of the property is in dispute or difficult of determination, the safest course will be for the police to retain the property until one of the parties obtains the order of a court. Such case shall be reported to the Director General for orders. 
1. The police shall not hand over property seized in a criminal case to a person, other than the one from whom it was taken, without the orders of a court or Magistrate. 

**Live-Stock** 

137\. The seizure of live-stock by the police in criminal cases shall be forthwith reported to the Magistrate for orders under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Pending the orders of the Magistrate regarding its disposal, the live-stock shall remain in the custody of the police, but they may deliver it to the charge of the Village Officer or its owner to be produced when required. The Magistrate having jurisdiction will be responsible for the cost of its feeding in cases other than those in which it is handed over to the owner.

Chapter 111 

**Scientific Aids to Investigation** 

**Introduction** 

138\. In order to make the investigations objective, impartial and value-neutral, use of various scientific aids to investigations must be made. Systematic, scientific and in depth questioning and interrogation techniques are primarily tools of investigation with police. The facts and evidence  so  collected  could  be  further  substantiated  and  corroborated  with  the  help  of scientific analysis and examination of various exhibits, items and materials available on the scene of crime or collected during investigation.  

139\. **The Scientific Techniques** 

I.A wide range of scientific techniques are now available for analysis of varied nature 

of objects and materials encountered in the process of commission of crime by the culprit in and around the crime scene, on the suspect and victim. The study of such material evidence also known as objective evidence or physical evidence applying latest scientific tools and techniques for proving the guilt or innocence of the accused by the courts of law is broadly known as Forensic Science. 

II.The applications/aid of science to the crime investigation is fundamentally one of 

reconstruction, that is, trying to assist in determining what happened, where it happened, when it happened, and who was involved. It is not concerned with, and cannot determine, why something happened. Forensic analysis is performed on evidence to assist the police and the court in establishing physical facts so that criminal or civil disputes can be resolved. It is the job of the forensic scientist to translate the legal inquiry into appropriate scientific questions, and to advice the Investigating  Officer  and/or  the  judiciary  on  the  capabilities,  limitations  and results of the analytical techniques. 

III.In forensic science, the laws of various facets of science are applied in conducting on analysis to determine the nature and characteristics of Physical Evidence collected 

in  the  process  of  crime  or  civil  investigation.  Using  the  scientific  methods, 

111

inferences are drawn about how the evidence can be linked to crime and criminal. These inferences are thus connected to the events that may or may not have taken place in connection with said evidence. The law defines elements of a crime; science contributes information to assist in determining whether an element is present or absent. 

IV.It is an established fact that the criminals while committing crimes either due to 

carelessness or due to anxiety, or due to contact with other objects leave traces at the scenes and these are the basis for scientifically exploiting their culpability. This  physical  evidence  when  located,  collected,  preserved  and  forwarded  for scientific evaluation and report is bound to have enormous potential in linking the criminal to the crime scene, victim or any other circumstances leading to the crime. Moreover evidence collected and based on scientific evolution and report is unbiased, universally acceptable and also stands the test of time. 

140\. **Institutions to Provide Scientific Aids to Police** 

1) **Central Forensic Science Laboratory:** The Central Forensic Laboratory is situated at Delhi. Scientific aid, assistance, help and guidance can be obtained from the experts of CFSL by the Investigating Officer in case of need and urgency. 
1) **State Forensic Laboratory (SFL)** Every State has a State level Forensic Science  Laboratory  with  various  wings  along  with  regional  or  district branches to provide scientific help to police on various subjects. 
1) **Professor of Forensic Medicine & Medico-legal Services:** The Professors of  Forensic  Medicine  working  in  Medical  Colleges  are  responsible  for providing Medico-legal services to the investigating officers in the respective districts. The services rendered by a medico-legal expert extend to both the living and the dead individuals. 'Clinical Forensic Medicine' deals with the medico-legal  examination  of  the  livings  pertaining  to  wounds,  sexual offences, age determination, poisoning whereas the 'Forensic Pathology' deals with that of the dead like autopsies, examination of mutilated/fragmentary and skeletal remains, exhumation etc. 

113

4) **Clinical Forensic Medicine:** Wounds cases are examined to decide the type (eg. Abrasion), age and nature (simple/grievous) of the wound as well as the type of the weapon (blunt/sharp) responsible for the same. In sexual offence cases, both the accused and the victim are examined for signs of recent sexual intercourse. Further, the accused in particular is examined for potency and the victim for determination of her age, if required. Age determination is also conducted  in  cases  such  as  kidnapping,  juvenile  crime  and  disputed  age claims. 
4) **Forensic Pathology:** Dead bodies (whether fresh, decomposed or exhumed and whether intact or fragmented and mutilated) as well as skeletal remains can  be  examined  for  establishing  the  cause  and  time  since  death  and  for possible  clues  to  establish  the  identity  of  unidentified  bodies.  Injuries, poisoning or asphyxia commonly causes unnatural or violent deaths while disease  processes  cause  natural  or  sudden  deaths.  A  host  of  physical characteristics and traits help in identification of the body while the onset and progress of the post-mortem changes are of use in estimating the time that has elapsed since death. 
4) **Fingerprints  Bureau  (State  Crime  Records  Bureau):**  The  Director, Fingerprints Bureau and his supporting staff at the head quarters and at Single Digit  Finger  Print  Sections  at  district  level  are  responsible  for  lifting, collecting and matching the finger prints in all criminal cases. 
4) **Explosives/Bomb  Disposal  Experts:**  In  all  matters  relating  to  explosive substances the relevant agencies have to be contacted by the Investigating officers  in  handling,  investigating,  defusion  and  disposal  of  explosive substances. 
4) **Miscellaneous Institutes:** In every State there are institutions like Institute of Preventive Medicine, Chemical Examiner-Prohibition & Excise, Government Food  Laboratories,  and  Government  Drug  Control  Laboratories  which provide  help  and  assistance  to  the  Investigating  Officer  in  the  respective areas. 

141\. **Purpose of Physical Evidence in Crime Investigation**  

1. The  word  Physical  Evidence  denotes  all  evidence  having  certain  physical dimensions such as size, shape, pattern, length, width, height, volume etc., which can be preserved, lifted, collected, packed and forwarded for scientific analysis to the specialist concerned. Physical evidence can alternatively be called as material evidence,  objective  evidence,  circumstantial  evidence  or  indirect  evidence  in different contexts. Physical Evidence includes all naturally occurring substances as well as machine/men made objects in the Universe. 
1. The goal of physical evidence examination is to provide useful information for criminal  investigators  in  solving  crimes  and  for  courts  of  law  during  the adjudication  of  these  cases.  The  following  leads  can  be  obtained  from  the examination of physical evidence in the process of investigation. 
1. **Information on the Corpus Delicti:** The corpus delicti (literally means the "body of the crime") refers to those essential facts which show that a crime has taken place. For example, tool marks, broken doors or windows, ransacked rooms, and missing valuables would be important in establishing that a burglary has taken place. Similarly, in an assault case, the victim's blood, a weapon, or torn clothing could be important pieces of physical evidence. 
1. **Information on the Modus Operandi (MO):** Many criminals have a particular modus operandi or (MO), which is their characteristic way of committing a crime. Physical evidence can help in establishing an MO. In burglary cases, for example, the point of entry, the means used to gain entry, tools that were used and articles stolen may all establish an identifiable method of operation. In arson cases, the types  of  accelerant  used  and  the  way  the  fires  were  set  constitute  physical evidence that helps to establish the "signature" of an arsonist. Similarly the type of  explosive  remnants,  triggering  devices,  timing  devices,  containers  and composition of explosive substances used in the making of Bombs and IED's establish  the  commonness  of  source/origin  of  Improvised  Explosive  Devices (IED's) in serial blast cases. Analysis of physical evidence is one important way of linking cases in the investigation of a "serial" killer or rapist. 
5. **Linking a Suspect with a Victim:** This linkage is one of the most common and important  aspects  that  physical  evidence  can  help  to  establish.  Blood,  hairs, clothing fibers, cosmetics and other items from the victim may be transferred to a perpetrator. Items found in a suspect's possession can sometimes be linked to a victim, for example through the comparison of bullets with a weapon seized from the suspect; the suspect can be linked with crime. It is also possible that evidence is transferred from a perpetrator to a victim; in rape, murder and assault cases. 
5. **Linking a Person to a Crime Scene:** This type of link is also one of the most vital  in  a  crime  scene  investigation.  Numerous  types  of  evidence  may  be deposited by the person committing a crime, including fingerprints, foot prints, blood, hair, fibers, and soil. In addition, the type of weapons or objects used may also  leave  evidence,  for  example,  bullets  and  cartridge  cases  or  tool  marks. Depending on the type of crime, various kinds of evidence from the scene may be carried away intentionally, as a stolen property and unintentionally as a transfer of trace evidence such as carpet fibers or hairs on the criminal's shoes or clothing. These materials are extremely useful in linking an individual to a particular crime scene. 
5. **Disproving or Supporting a Witness' Testimony:** Physical evidence analysis can often indicate conclusively whether a person's version of a set of events is credible, or whether an alibi put forth is convincing or not. For example, the examination of a car, which fits the description of a hit and run vehicle, might reveal blood on the underside of the bumper. If the owner of the vehicle claims he hit a dog, laboratory tests on the blood can reveal whether the blood is from a dog or  from  a  human  and  further  testing  for  DNA  Profiling  may  reveal  the  truth relating to the accident and victim. 

VIII.     **Identification of a Suspect:**  The best evidence for identifying a suspect is his or 

her  palm  prints  and  evidence  such  as  blood,  semen,  saliva,  skin  tissues  etc. collected for DNA Finger Printing examination. A fingerprint found at a scene, and later identified as belonging to a particular person, results in an unequivocal identification of that person as having been at the scene. The term identification when  applied  to  people  really  means  "individualization"  (identifying  a  single unique source). 

9. **Providing  Investigative  Leads:**  Physical  evidence  analysis  can  assist  the investigator  in  pursuing  a  productive  path,  by  providing  clues  from  the characteristics  of  the  physical  evidence.  In  a  hit-and-run  case,  for  example, examination of a chip of paint found in the victim's clothing could be used to provide  information  on  the  colour  and  possibly  the  model  and  year,  of  the automobile involved. With the rapid emergence of computerized fingerprint and DNA data-bases, the ability of physical evidence to provide investigative leads has increased enormously. 
9. **Identification  of  a  Substance:**  The  results  of  examining  a  piece  of  physical evidence can provide information on the identity of a particular substance. As indicated above, this is a classification process. In its simplest form, such as in the identification of cocaine, heroin, LSD, morphine or any other type of drug, it meets  the  legal  requirement  for  classification  as  a  controlled  substance. Laboratory  analysis  of  fibers  can  sometimes  yield  information  on  the manufacturer of the fabric or garment. Simple identification of many types of physical evidence can provide critical information for use in the investigation or prosecution of a case. 
9. **Crime Scene Reconstruction:** Transient evidence such as odour, temperature (of car engine, fire debris etc), imprints, marks/stains; pattern evidence like blood stain patterns, skid mark patterns, gun shot residue patterns, projectile trajectory patterns,  glass  fracture  patterns  etc.,  and  conditional  evidence  such  as  light, smoke,  fire,  water,  piled  up  news  papers  etc.,  will  play  a  key  role  in reconstruction  of  the  events  surrounding  the  crime  scene  and  the  nature  of offence.  Sometimes  it  may  also  give  valuable  leads  regarding  the  perpetrator based on the individual traits in relation to the evidentiary pattern. 

**Sources of Physical Evidence** 

142\. The primary source of physical evidence is generally the crime scene but it is by no means the only source. Many crimes occur over multiple scenes and many criminals carry physical evidence away from the actual scene in addition to leaving evidence behind. The victim, suspect and some times the witnesses are major sources of physical evidence. The methodology of search depends on the case and the scene. The purpose of the search is to look for clues  and for evidence of what happened during the crime. It is not a random groping in dark but rather a directed search for objects and materials. Recognizing, recording, collecting, marking, packaging and preserving evidence discovered while searching a crime scene is the basic essential duty of the investigating officer. In cases where the evidence is of a  common  nature,  i.e.,  evidence,  which  is  not  hidden  and  is  easily  collectable,  without expert's assistance, the Investigating Officer should invariably collect all possible forms of physical evidence. For other kinds of evidence the investigator should take the assistance of CLUES Team or medico-legal experts. Some types of physical evidence, which are hidden, latent or fragile, require scientific procedures for location as well as collection and packing. In such circumstances the involvement of CLUES team from the initial stages of inspection is essential.  

**Significance of physical evidence** 

143\. The major purpose of examination of physical evidence by a forensic scientist is to identify or absolutely determine the nature of the material or to compare two substances in order to know whether they possess the same characteristics and composition, with a view to establish their commonness of origin. 

1) **Identification:** The absolute determination of the biological, physical or chemical nature of a substance is the purpose of identification. This information helps the police officer to secure leads for further investigation or confirm his hypothesis or draw certain inferences and conclusions based on other circumstantial evidences, e.g. 
1. Identification of specific poison in the viscera of a person who died under suspicious circumstances. 
2. Identification of an inflammable material in the burnt clothing of young woman in a dowry death case.  
2. Identification of a reddish stain to be blood in a case where the suspect claims it to be a vegetable stain or a synthetic dye. 
2. Absolute  determination  of  a  white  powder  to  be  cocaine  in  case  of  illicit  drug trafficking. 
2) **Comparison:** The comparison of two or more substances, usually crime and control specimens,  is  generally  undertaken  to  establish  commonness  of  origin  (source)  of  the materials involved. For example, the forensic scientist may assist in placing a suspect at a particular location by matching similarities in the hair found at the crime scene to the hair collected from the suspect. Similarly, comparison of a paint chip found on a road accident victim's  clothing  with  the  paint  removed  from  a  suspected  vehicle  might  prove  its involvement  in  the  accident. Comparing  chance fingerprints  at  the  crime scene with  the fingerprints of the suspected persons may establish their association with the crime. 
2) **Individual Characteristics:*** Evidence that can be traced to a common source with an extremely high degree of probability is said to possess individual characteristics. Examples of this type are the matching ridge characteristics of the fingerprints, the comparison of random striation marks on bullets, tool marks, irregular and random tread patterns in tyre or footwear impressions and handwriting for authorship determination. 
2) **Class characteristics:*** Evidence is said-to possess class or group characteristics when it can only be traced to a group and not to a single source. Here, probability is a determining factor. Class characteristics help provide leads and corroborate evidence. 

   **List of documents to be sent with exhibits** 

   144\. Following documents should be sent along with the covering letter while forwarding exhibits of the FSL. 

1) Forwarding letter/authorization letter of competent authorities (Order 549-8) 
1) Letter of advice from Investigating Officers 
1) Doctor's   Report   (post-mortem examination)   in   Toxicology   cases,   Medical examination Report of victim and accused (if arrested) in rape and serology cases. 
1) Confessional  Statements  of  suspects/accused,  statements  of  witnesses,  etc.,  in 

   Polygraph cases. 

5) Inquest/Panchanama copies in Toxicology cases.  
5) FIR copies where desirable. 
5) Sample seal on a sheet of paper, or on forwarding letter/letter of advice.  
5) Any other document relevant for examination 

145\. **Forensic Science & Scientific aid to Investigation** 

1. Forensic  science  is  a  dynamic  field  comprising  of  mainly  the  application  of  various branches of science to the administration of justice in a criminal justice system. The criminal investigation is a team effort, where the Police and the Forensic Scientist have co-ordinate role to play. The effective prosecution of a case can be achieved largely by 
   1. Producing the evidence in a legally admissible form 
   1. Scientific examination and analysis of clue materials 
   1. Evaluating the result of scientific analysis and interpreting them and 
   1. Effective use of forensic findings in the prosecution. 
1. The major contribution of forensic science is in the area of scientific examination and analysis of evidence materials either collected from the scene of crime or obtained by the investigating agency during the course of investigation. Further, significant contribution can also be made to improve the efficiency of the investigation by the presence of the forensic scientists at the scene of crime to precisely decide on the nature of clue materials on which reliance  could  be  placed  either  during  the  investigation  and/or  during  the  trial.  Forensic science has gained tremendous evidentiary value owing to the rapid development of science and technology. The outstanding advancement of forensic science is in the area of DNA (DEOXY RIBO NUCLEIC ACID) profiling on the basis of which it has become possible to precisely fix the identity by analyzing tissues, bones, hairs, and body fluids including semen of the accused or victim. 
1. The Forensic Science Laboratory has great responsibility in aiding the investigation right from the examination of scene of offence to the level of rendering evidence before the courts of law in the system. The FSL primarily caters to the needs of investigation at various stages, thereby producing an impaction the quality of investigation in the areas mentioned below: 
- Recognition of evidence materials at the scene of crime 
- Collection and preservation of the clue materials so recognized 
- Analysis, examination and testifying the forensic findings and 
- Interpretation of the forensic results 

146\. **Principles of Forensic Science** 

1. **Principle of Exchange** 

This was the first and foremost concept that led to the systematic development of forensic science.  A  French  scientist  Prof.  Edmand  Locard  while  working  in  the  University  of Lausanne, Switzerland in 1928 proposed this theory, i.e. *"When any two objects come into contact, each of them will leave its traces on to the other".* The transfer of traces may be in the form of materials or impressions. Such transference may be large or small, visible or invisible, detectable readily or difficult to detect. Nevertheless, transference does occur. It is the responsibility of the investigating officer to search, locate and collect it. 

2. **Law of Individuality** 

Every object natural or man made, animate or inanimate has some individuality/uniqueness of its own which is not repeated in any other objects*.* The natural objects are; human beings, animals, plants, leaves, seeds, insects, wood, soil etc., whereas the man made objects are; tools, guns, bullets, shoes, pens, paper, ink, pills etc. 

3. **Law of Progressive Change** 

Everything in the Universe undergoes a change as the time progresses. 

People undergo change with the passage of time. Criminal disguise themselves or adopt alibi to hide their identity. Witnesses also change as they become hostile, or get influenced to change  their  earlier  testimonies.  Policemen  also  get  transferred,  promoted  and  go  on retirement. Likewise; judges also get transferred, promoted and go on retirement. Likewise lawyers,  prosecutors,  places,  crime  scene  also  undergo  various  changes.  Similarly  the materials/objects also undergo various changes and they become volatile and decomposed due to chemical, physical and biological transformation. 

4. **Principle of Comparison** 

The  principle  of  comparison  is  based  on  the  hypothesis  that  only  like  things  can  be compared. No purpose will be served if comparison is made between black fiber and black hair,  grey hair and grey fiber, bullet .38 and bullet .32, nylon fiber and cotton fiber, Telugu Writing- English Writing, etc. 

5. **Principle of Analysis** 

The  analysis  can  be  no  better  than  the  sample  itself.  Hence  the  importance  of  proper collection of sample and also its integrity and chain of custody is of great significance. 

6. **Law of Probability** 

All identifications definite or indefinite are made consciously or unconsciously on the basis of Probability. 

**Technical Application for Police Work** 

147\.  Enhancement  of  police  efficiency  and  the  professional  competence  necessitate  that adequate use of various technological aids, equipment and techniques is made in the working of police functioning. This technical application has to be integrated with every aspect of police  working  like  investigation  work,  maintenance  of  Law  and  Order,  arms  and ammunition  along  with communication  and  transportation.  For  an effective  and  efficient technical application and technological advancement in the police functioning, the various areas and units like FSL, training, security equipment and police functional aids should be updated from time to time. There are many types of equipment which a modern police force should  have.  These  range  from  office  equipments  like  fax,  photocopiers,  modern  and dynamic furniture, computers, internet to equipment like wireless, night vision devices, metal detectors, bomb disposal equipment, binoculars, body protectors, bullet proof vests, tear gas, arms and ammunition, cameras, recording devices etc., etc.

Chapter 9

**Final Disposal & Completion of Investigation** 

**Introduction** 

154\. On the receipt of a report about the commission of a cognizable offence, an FIR is registered  at the police  station.  Thereafter the IO undertakes  several  steps  for  collecting evidence  against  the  accused  person(s).  If  there  is  enough  evidence  against  the  accused person(s), the case is sent for trial to the court of law, and if enough and sufficient evidence is not available against the accused person(s), the police would close the investigation as Final Report (FR); and the case file will be sent to the court for approving the investigation. This whole process is called Investigation. 

155\. **Quick & Early Completion of Investigation**  

1) Section 173 CrPC lays down that every investigation by police made under Chapter XII Cr.P.C. shall be completed without unnecessary delay. All investigations must be completed within the time limit provided under section 468 CrPC. No court will take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of that period. The period of limitation is as follows: 
- Six months if the offence is punishable with fine only; 
- One year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not-exceeding one year; 
- Three  years,  if  the  offence  is  punishable  with  imprisonment  not  exceeding  three years, 
2) The prosecution will have to explain the reasons for the delay if the charge sheet is filed after  the  expiry  of  the  period  of  limitation.  The  Court  has  to  be  satisfied  with  reasons adduced for delay. Sections 469 to 472 CrPC deal with the commencement of limitation, exclusion of time in certain cases etc. 
2) As per section 167(5) CrPC, when the police officer arrests a person in a summons case and if the investigation is not completed within 6 months and whether the person is on bail or in custody, the magistrate is competent to order the closure of the investigation and on such order further investigation is not allowed unless ordered by the session court. Therefore in such cases, it must be ensured that the investigation is completed within that period. 
2) Section 167(2)(a) CrPC empowers the Court to order release of the accused in custody if the charge sheet is not filed within 60 days or 90 days as the case may be. Hence, the IO should  complete  the  investigation  in  the  above  cases  within  the  time  prescribed.  If  the investigation could not be completed within the said period of 60 or 90 days the accused will be entitled for bail. Care must be taken to speed up investigation in such cases if the accused is to be continued in remand. However, incomplete charge sheet shall not be filed for the sake of keeping the accused in remand. 
2) Sections 173(8) Cr.P.C. provides for a supplementary or additional charge sheet. This provision is not a substitute for original charge sheet. This provision is meant for filing a subsequent charge sheet only when there is fresh and further evidence about the offence or offender, which is not known at the time of filing the first charge sheet. 

   **Charge Sheets** 

   156\. If, upon the completion of an investigation, it appears to the Officer-in-charge of a Police Station that there is sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charge sheet against the accused, he will submit to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of the offence, a charge sheet setting forth therein the names of the parties with their full addresses and of the persons, who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case, stating whether the accused (if arrested) has been forwarded in custody or has been released on bond, and, if so, whether with or without sureties. The names of such of the accused as are absconding should be entered in red ink in the appropriate column of the charge sheet. Care should be taken to see that all the columns in the charge sheet are filled in properly. No column should be left blank. The officer-in-charge of the Police Station shall also communicate the action taken by him to the person, if any, by whom the information relating to the commission of the offence was first given. Once the investigation is completed and a prima facie case is made out, there should be no delay in the submission of the charge sheet. 

   157\. **Features of Charge Sheet and its Preparations** 

1. The charge should be brief but at the same time clear. The date, time and place of offence should invariably be mentioned in the charge. In simple cases, the charge sheets shall be prepared by Sub-Inspectors in consultation with the Inspector, where necessary. In cases involving complicated points of law, the charge sheets should be prepared in consultation with the Assistant Public Prosecutor, and also the Public Prosecutor, where necessary. In important and complicated cases, it is advisable to consult the assistant Public Prosecutor or Public Prosecutor, if necessary, even at the stage of investigation, in order to enable the Investigating Officer to conduct the investigation on proper lines and to collect the type of evidence required by law to bring home the guilt of the accused. 
1. In  every  case  in  which  an  accused  person  previously  convicted  of  an  offence punishable  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, is prosecuted for an offence punishable under either of the two chapters, with like imprisonment, Section 75 of the Indian Penal Code should be added in the charge-sheet. 
1. While all documents or relevant extracts thereof on which the prosecution proposes to rely  other  than  those  already  sent  to  the  Magistrate  during  investigation  and  the statements  recorded  under  section  161  Cr.P.C.  of  all  the  persons  whom  the prosecution proposes to examine as its witness should be forwarded to the Magistrate along with the report under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The investigating officer should furnish to the accused copies of the documents.  
1. If the Police officer is of the opinion that any part of statements recorded under Sub- Section (3) of Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not relevant to the subject  matter  of  the  inquiry  or  trial  or  that  its  disclosure  to  the  accused  is  not 

   essential in the interest of justice and is inexpedient in the public interest, he shall exclude such part from the copy of the statement furnished to the accused, and in such a case, he shall make a report to the Magistrate stating his reason for excluding such part. 

158\. **Absconders and Proclaimed Offenders** 

1. Where an accused person against whom a charge sheet is being filed is absconding, the officer-in-charge of the Police Station shall append a note on the charge sheet itself requesting the Magistrate to issue a non bailable warrant for the apprehension of the accused. If the warrant cannot be executed within a reasonable time, the Station House  Officer  or  the  Investigating  Officer  shall  move  the  court  for  instituting proceedings under Sections 82 and 83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. If it is proved that there is no immediate prospect of arresting the accused even after action has been taken under section 82 and 83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court may, in the absence of the accused, examine the witnesses produced on behalf of the prosecution and record their depositions under Section 299 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. If, at any future time, the accused person is apprehended or appears before the court, the case against him shall be revived and dealt with according to law. Any such deposition recorded in the absence of the accused may, on the arrest of such person, be given in evidence against him in the inquiry into or trial of the offence with which he is charged, if the deponent is dead or incapable of giving evidence or his  attendance  cannot  be  procured  without  an  amount  of  delay,  expense  or inconvenience which, under the circumstances of the case, would be unreasonable. 
1. Where  there  are  several  accused  persons  in  a  case  and  only  some  of  them  have appeared  or  have  been  produced  before  the  court  and  the  presence  of  the  other accused cannot be secured within a reasonable time, steps should be taken to move the Magistrate to proceed with the case against such of the accused as have appeared and dispose it of according to law reserving the right of the State to proceed against the other accused, when their presence is secured. 
1. Proclamation orders under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  can be issued against any person for whose arrest the Magistrate has issued a warrant. The Investigating Officer has only to convince the court that the warrantee is evading arrest and has gone into hiding and that the warrant could not be executed. Hence, the initiative has to be taken by the Investigating Officer. Once the proclamation orders are  issued  they  should  be  immediately  promulgated.  Orders  of  attachment  under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can also be issued simultaneously along with the proclamation orders. The period of 30 days mentioned in Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is the time allowed to the accused to surrender. The Court issuing a proclamation under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure may at any time order the attachment of any property moveable or immovable both belonging to the proclaimed person. Attachment should be carried out promptly after the proclamation has been properly made and the property of the proclaimed person seized before he has time to transfer, alienate, mortgage or conceal them. 
4. It is necessary that the proclamation order issued under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure should be widely published in the manner provided for in that section. In order to facilitate the arrest of an absconding warrantee or a proclaimed offender,  it  is  also  necessary  that  an  effective  watch  is  maintained  over  his harbourers.  Persons  who  willfully  or  knowingly  harbor  such  offenders  could  be prosecuted under Section 216 of the Indian Penal Code. It is, therefore, necessary that the widest publicity is given to the proclamation order issued under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure so that its knowledge can be conclusively proved against the harbourers for his successful prosecution under Section 216 of the Indian Penal Code. 
4. The Station House Officer should not be satisfied or rest content that the formalities under Sections 82 and 83 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been gone through. As long as the proclaimed offender's name is on the list of proclaimed offenders of his station, he and his station staff are responsible for finding out where he is and who is harboring him. If the proclaimed offender is learnt to be in the jurisdiction of another station, he should forthwith inform the Station House Officer of the other station  to  arrest  him.  Preferably,  he  can  proceed  himself  or  in  unavoidable circumstances send his subordinates immediately to arrest the wanted person with the help of the other station staff. 

159\. **Duty of SHO and IO** 

1. The charge sheet shall be prepared, forwarded and presented to the court only by the SHO/I.O. The IO should prepare report giving the details of the case, discuss the nature  of  evidence  and  the  liability  or  otherwise  of  each  accused,  the  probable defence and its plausibility or otherwise and finally the action proposed by him. 
1. The IO while considering the case should not act as a mere post office to transmit each and every case to the Court. At the same time it is also not desirable that he should usurp the function of the trial court by examining the evidence inch by inch. Availability of sufficient evidence does not mean sufficient ground for conviction but such  evidence as  would  be sufficient  to  put  the accused  on  trial.  Where  there  is reasonable doubt, as to what evidence is to be believed, it is better the SHO sends the case to the Court which is the proper authority to resolve the doubt. Where two views are possible the case should be sent for trial.     
1. After completion of the investigation the SHO shall forward the file to the APP for his opinion whether the material is sufficient to charge the case and also to discuss with the APP in person.   The APP after perusing the case file shall give his opinion. If further investigation is necessary he shall give his opinion in accordance with the guidelines. If the material is sufficient for charge sheet, he shall give a draft charge sheet. On receipt of the same the SHO shall file charge sheet or investigate further as the case may be. If further investigation is carried out it will be once again submitted to the APP for charge sheet.  In small and simple cases, the SHO may file charge sheet  himself  but  where  the  police  expect  the  APP  to  conduct  the  prosecution successfully and with responsibility, the above procedure shall be followed. 
1. In case of all grave crimes and in sessions cases the SDPO should submit the file for orders to SP/Additional SP with his comments.  

**Juvenile Offenders** 

160\. When a juvenile accused is arrested or prosecuted, information about the age of such accused should invariably be furnished to the court by the Police officer taking action in the case to enable the court to determine the age of the accused.  

161\. **Sanction for Prosecution** 

1. Sections 195 to 199 of the Code of Criminal Procedure mention the cases of which the courts shall not take cognizance without the sanction of, or complaint by some competent authority. In such cases, it should be seen that the required sanction is got when the investigation is completed and the original sanction should be attached to the charge sheet when laid in the court.  
1. Prosecutions under Section 182 or Section 211 of the Indian Penal Code should not be initiated without the orders of the Superintendent or the Sub-Divisional Police officer.  For  prosecutions  under  Section  182,  Indian  Penal  Code,  a  complaint  in writing  should  be  made  to  the  Magistrate  having  jurisdiction  by  the  officer  who registered the case, his successor or his immediate superior officer under Section 195(1) (a), Criminal Procedure Code. Presentation of charge sheets in such cases is illegal, as the court has to take cognizable directly under section 190Cr.PC. 
1. No prosecution for an offence punishable under Section 211 of the Indian Penal Code shall be launched, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to a proceeding in any court except on the complaint in writing of such court or some other court to which such court is subordinate.  

162\. **Final Reports** 

1. If, after the completion of an investigation, the Investigating Officer considers that in spite of all steps taken, there is no prospect of obtaining any further clue and that nothing more can be done in the case, he will submit a final report treating the case as undetectable, unoccured, without sufficient evidence or report made due to genuine misunderstanding. But, in instances where cases have to be referred as mistake of fact, mistake of law, civil in nature or false, the final* report should be submitted forthwith. In cases where accused person or persons dies/die before the completion of investigation and no person or persons can be charged, a final report should be sent to the Magistrate having jurisdiction.  
1. Cases must not be reported as false unless they are clearly so. Mere probability will 

   not suffice. Delay in referring cases as false must be particularly avoided, and cases in which there has been serious delay must be returned as undetectable, unless fresh facts are elicited demonstrating them to be false. In cases disposed of under Section 173  and  proviso  (b)  to  sub-section  (1)  of  Section  157  of  the  Code  of  Criminal Procedure,  including  charged  cases,  the  police  have  to  serve  a  notice  on  the complainant or informant and forward the duplicate, duly endorsed, with the final report to the Magistrate. In cases in which investigation is refused, a copy of the notice will be attached to the First Information Report sent to court. Final reports have to be sent through the Circle Officer who is bound to forward them to the Magistrate without delay, noting upon them any orders issued to the Station House Officer and any remarks that he may have to offer. The Inspector may order the Station House Officer to make further inquiry or do so himself.  

**Order of Magistrates on Final Reports** 

163\. On receipt  of  a  final report  under Section 173 of  the  Code of  Criminal  Procedure referring a case as false, mistake of fact or law, or civil nature or undetectable, the Magistrate may order further investigation, but it is not open to him to direct the police to charge the case against their own report. The Magistrate has powers to take action himself under Section 190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, if he is not satisfied with the report of the police in such a case. The fact that a final report has been sent in a case reporting it as undetected is no bar to further investigation. Further investigation may be taken up *suo moto* in such cases, if any fresh clues are forthcoming or under orders of a superior officer. It must be noted that the police are to lay charge-sheets only in cases investigated by them. 

**Appeal Against Acquittal** 

164\. The procedure prescribed for filing appeals and revisions in respect of cases ending in acquittal or discharge in the Magistrate's or Sessions Courts should be adopted for making appeals and revision in the concerned courts. In cases ending in acquittal in the High Court, the Advocate General within 10 days from the date of the judgment will forward one copy of the judgment with his remarks whether or not, there are grounds for preferring an application for a certificate under article 134 or for the grant of special leave under article 136 of the Constitution to the Law Department and send another copy with a copy of his remarks to the Director of Prosecutions who while keeping the Superintendent informed, may furnish his remarks, if any, direct to the Law Department. 

165\. **Withdrawal of Cases** 

1) According to section 321 Cr PC the Public Prosecutor in charge of a case may with the consent of the Court, at any time before the judgment is pronounced , withdraw from the prosecution of any person either generally or in respect of any one or more of the offences for which he is tried, provided that - where 
   1. such offence was against any law relating to a matter within the executive power of the Union, extends or 
   1. it was investigated by the Delhi Special Police Establishment, or 
   1. the accused involved in misappropriation or destruction or damage to any property belonging to the Central Government, or 
   1. the offence was committed by a person in the service of Central Government while acting in discharge of his official duty and the prosecutor in charge of the case has not been appointed by the Central Government, he shall not, unless he has been permitted by the Central Government to do so, move the court for its consent to withdraw from the prosecution. 
1) The Public Prosecutor or Assistant Public   Prosecutor   is   bound   to   receive instructions of the Government regarding the withdrawal of the case from the court. 
1) The opinion of the Superintendent of Police concerned will be taken by the Government through the Home Department before taking a decision for withdrawal of the case. 
1) The Public Prosecutor has to make out grounds which would show that the prosecution 

   is sought to be withdrawn because inter-alia the prosecution might not be able to produce sufficient evidence to sustain the charge or that the prosecution does not appear to be well founded  or  that  there  are  other  circumstances  which  clearly  show  that  the  object  of administration  of  justice  would  not  be  advanced  or  furthered  by  going  on  with  the prosecution. The ultimate guiding consideration must be the interest of administration of justice. 

   **Strictures** 

   166\. In the case of judgments in which there are strictures, the following action should be 

   taken - 

1) As soon as a judgment in a criminal case filed by the police is concluded in the court, the concerned Prosecutor and the Investigating Officer will examine the judgment for any strictures or other remarks, either generally on the investigation or prosecution of the case or especially against any Police Officer or other Government servant. 
1) When there are strictures or other remarks, the Prosecutor will at once obtain a copy of the judgment and send it with his remarks to the Deputy Director of Prosecutions who will* then examine the judgment and forward it to the concerned Range Inspector General of Police and Commissioner of Police with his report and arrange to take appropriate  action  against  the  concerned  Police  Officer  for  the  judicial  strictures passed against them. He will then submit the* records to the Director General along with his report indicating the nature of action taken in the matter. 
1) In the case of strictures or other remarks in judgments pronounced by the High Court, the Advocate General will send with his comments, a copy of the judgments to the Director of Prosecutions who will transmit them to the Director General along with his remarks for appropriate action. 
1) The Superintendent while furnishing his remarks required under Sub-Order (2) will specifically mention  whether  or  not the strictures or remarks  are  justified; and  if unjustified, what action he has taken for their expunction. The IGP will also furnish his specific opinion in that behalf. 
1) If any strictures or other adverse remarks, either against a Police Officer generally on the investigation or prosecution of the case, are wholly unjustified or excessive or deserve expunction, the Superintendent   will   take   prompt   action   to    obtain   the   opinion   of   the Advocate-General and for addressing the Government for sanction to move the High Court, for expunction. 
1) If the Advocate General makes a recommendation and the Government sanction the filing  of  a  revision  for  the  expunction  of  the  strictures  or  other  remarks,  the Superintendent  should  promptly  send  to  the  Director  General  a  copy  of  the Government order and make available to the Advocate General all relevant records he may require in that behalf for filing the revision.  
1) If  the  Advocate  General  does  not  make  a  recommendation  and  the  Government consider that no action is called for, the opinion of the Advocate General and the orders of the Government will indicate to what extent the strictures or other remarks are  justified.    The  Superintendent  will  then  take  appropriate  action  against  the 

   defaulting Police Officers. 

8) When a revision is filed in the High Court for the expunction of the strictures or other adverse remarks, the Superintendent will obtain from the Advocate General, a copy of the judgment and send it to the Director General. 
8) If the High Court dismisses the revision petition refusing to expunge the strictures or other  remarks,  and  observes  that  they  are  justified,  the  Superintendent  will  take appropriate  action  for  their  avoidance  in  the  subsequent  cases  and  also  institute departmental proceedings against the defaulting Police Officers. He will send a report of action taken to the Director General. 
8) Every  Commissioner/  Range  Inspector  General  and  Superintendent  of  Police  will maintain a register of judicial strictures and commendations.  The registers are useful for  the  officers  to  have  an  overall  impression  of  the  judicial  appreciation  of  the standards of investigation and prosecution in a district. 
8) The Inspecting Officers at the time of their inspections will ensure that the registers have  been  properly  maintained  by  the  Commissioner/Inspector General/Superintendent and that he has issued appropriate instructions for improving the investigation and prosecution in his district/range. The Inspecting Officers will make a specific mention about their having checked the register, in their inspection notes. 
8) The law section will examine the judgment and the remarks furnished by the various officers and take action for the issue of appropriate instructions by law circulars and law  bulletins,  for  the  rectification  of  the  defects  and  lapses  pointed  out  in  the judgment. 
8) All departmental action arising out of judicial strictures in the judgment of courts will be pursued by the crime section of the Chief Office till final disposal.

Chapter 140 

**Prosecution of Cases** 

**Introduction** 

167\. Investigation and prosecution are two important aspects of the criminal justice system. Investigations are handled by police and the prosecution matters are handled by prosecutors. Police, after conducting the investigation of a case, sends it to the court of law for trial. The prosecutors of various categories assist the respective courts in the conduct of trials of the cases. Every State Government, therefore, has to maintain a regular cadre of prosecutors. The Head of the prosecution department is known as Director Prosecution and the department is known as Directorate of Prosecution. 

**Organisational Set Up** 

168\. The State Directorate is headed by the Director of Prosecutions. He is assisted in the administration  of  the  Department  by  Add,  Joint  and  Deputy  Directors.  The  Directorate consists  of  Public  Prosecutors  including  Additional  Public  Prosecutors,  Senior  Assistant Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors.  

**Director of Prosecutions** 

169\. The Director of prosecution is head of department of the prosecution wing. His powers, functions and duties are following:** 

1) To exercise powers of supervision and control over the work of the Joint Directors, Deputy  Directors,  Assistant  Public  Prosecutors,  the  Senior  Assistant  Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors; 
1) To  give  advice  and  instructions  to  the  Senior  Assistant  public  Prosecutors  and Assistant Public Prosecutors in the conduct of prosecutions, who shall abide by his advice and instructions; 
1) To review the work of the Deputy Directors, Public Prosecutors, Senior Assistant Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors and send reports thereon to the department of Law and Parliamentary Affairs through the Director General of Police; 
1) To  tender  opinion  and  advice  to  the  Director  General  of  Police  on  any  matter 

140

connected with the conduct of prosecution or investigation; 

5) To  send  periodical  reports  and  returns  to  the  Director  General  of  Police  and  the Government in the Department of Law and Parliamentary Affairs; 
5) generally to act in close co-operation and co-ordination with the Director General of Police in all matters connected with the conduct of prosecutions in Magistrates Courts and also with the work connected with the working of the Director of Prosecutions. 

170\. **Public Prosecutor and Assistant Public Prosecutors** 

1. The  Public  Prosecutors  are  appointed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of section  24  of  the  code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973.  The  Public  Prosecutor appears for the State and conducts prosecution in all session's cases, contests bail application, and argues appeal and criminal miscellaneous petitions in the Sessions Court and gives advice on legal matters. 
1. The  Assistant  Public  Prosecutors  are  appointed  in  accordance  with  the provisions  of  If  section  25  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1973.  The Assistant Public Prosecutors conduct prosecutions in the Magistrates' Courts. It shall be the duty of the APPs to advise the Investigating Officers in case advice is sought for. 
1. It  shall  be  their  duty  to  properly  examine  the  statements  recorded  by  the Investigating  Officer and  the  charges suggested. If  a lacuna is  found  in the investigation, they must request the Investigating office to rectify the matter. This should be done as far as possible through discussions. In case there is a difference  between  the  Investigating  Officer  and  the  Prosecutor,  the  matter should be reported to the concerned Superintendent of Police who would take it up with the Deputy Director. 
1. It shall be the duty of the Public Prosecutor to advise the Investigating Officer during  the  investigation  of  a  Sessions  case  when  so  requested  by  the Investigating Officer and it shall be further his duty to scrutinize the charge sheet  in  cases  where  the  charges  are  exclusively  triable  by  the  Court  of Sessions. Prosecutors should take utmost care in properly presenting the case 

142

before  the  Court  after  studying  the  case  adequately  and  interviewing  the witnesses to be examined in the Court. 

5. The Prosecutor, before presenting a charge-sheet, should carefully scrutinize it and ensure that it has been properly prepared, the accused have been charged under correct sections of law and that all the witnesses necessary for proving the prosecution  case  have  been  cited.  It  is  his  responsibility  to  obtain  from  the Investigating Officer, all necessary instructions before the presentation of the charge-sheet and be prepared to go on with the conduct of the case on the day the charge-sheet is presented to the Court. 
5. The Prosecutor as well as the Investigating Officer should bear in mind the relevant  provisions  regarding  limitations  for  taking  cognisance  of  certain offences as laid down in Chapter 36 of the Criminal Procedure Code Section 467 to 473. Here, Section 468 Cr.P.C. specifies the period for taking cognisance of an offence. Section 469 lays down as to when the period of limitation should begin to run in relation to an offence. Section 470 prescribes rules regarding exclusion  of  time  while  computing  the  period  of  limitation.  Section  471 provides for the exclusion of the day when the Court is closed. Section 472 lays down the period of limitation in cases of continuing offences. Section 473 lays down  as  to  when  the  period  of  limitation  may  be  extended  on  a  proper explanation of the delayer in the interest of justice. 
5. With regard to  charge-sheeting of a case,  where any  person  is arrested  and detained in custody and the investigation can not be completed in 24 hours, the provisions of Section 167 Cr.P.C. Sub-Section 2 should be kept in mind. 

**Co-ordination Contexts of Police and Prosecution** 

171\. Registration of Cases, investigations and filing of charge sheets are the areas where police and prosecution are required to co-ordinate their duties in mutuality. 

**Consultation with the Prosecutors** 

172\. The Investigating Officer must consult the Prosecutors in the following cases:- 

1) Cases which are exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions;                         
1) Cases under section 120-B IPC;  
1) Cases under section 121 to 130 IPC;  
1) Cases under section 231, 233, 235, 237, 239, 241, 242 to 250, 252, 253,254, 256 to 263 A IPC.     
1) Cases under section 295-A, 296 and 297 IPC;                                                                   (f) Cases under section 304-A, 330, 332, 353, 363, 365 IPC;                                                 
7) Cases under section 393, 394, 406 to 409, 419 and 420 IPC.  
7) Cases under section 465 to 468, 471 to 477 and 477-A IPC. 
7) When a case and counter case are registered and a decision has to be taken, whether both the cases have to be charge-sheeted or only one of them; 
7) Cases involving complicated questions of law / fact;  
7) Cases under the E.C.Act 1955; 
7) Any  other  case  where  the  IO/SDPO/DCP/SP  desire  that  the  Prosecutor  should  be consulted; 
7) Any case where the Prosecutor/Director/Deputy Director of Prosecutors considers that such consultation is necessary. 

172\.1 In respect of the cases referred to above, while sending the charge-sheets to the APPs the  Investigating  Officer  should  give  sufficient  time  to  the  Prosecutor  to  scrutinize  the charge-sheets. Along with the charge-sheet, the Investigating Officer should send the case diary file to the PP/APP to enable him to study the papers for scrutinizing the charge-sheet. If there is a difference of opinion between the Investigating Officer and the Prosecutor on any matter  pertaining  to  investigation  or  prosecution,  such  matters  should  be  referred  to  the Superintendent of Police, who shall take it up with the Deputy Director for further advice. 

173\. **Trial Contexts** 

1) **Sessions Case:*** District level senior police officers should attend the trial in Sessions Court  in  important  cases.  Probationary  Police  Officers  under  training  should  attend  the Sessions trial as many times as possible. The Inspector General of Police / Deputy Inspectors General during their inspection will satisfy themselves that attendance has been satisfactory and not omitted without good reasons. The IO/SHO should invariably cause the process issued to witnesses served well in time and produce the served process three days prior to the date of trial before the court under intimation to the public prosecutor and send the case diary file to him in advance. The Investigating Officer should assist the Public Prosecutor at least two days in advance of the commencement of the Sessions trial in ascertaining from the witnesses what they would be stating in Court, and what exhibits have to be marked through them. The Investigating Officer should give all facilities to the Public Prosecutor to visit the scene  of  occurrence.  The  Investigating  Officer  should  also  make  enquiries  and  furnish relevant material to the Public Prosecutor for the cross examination of defence witnesses. 
2) **In other cases:** The Investigating Officer should give all facilities to the APP to visit the scenes of occurrences in important cases and give him necessary instructions for conducting the prosecutions. During the course of trial, for the purpose of conducting prosecution in the case,  if  the  Prosecutor  requires  the  case  diary  file  for  his  study  and  reference,  the Investigating Officer should send the case diary file in advance, to the APP and also give him personal instructions, if necessary. The Investigating Officer should personally attend the Court on all dates of hearing, particularly in contested cases, unless he is held up on any other urgent duty, in which case, one of the ASIs/HCs should be sent to the court with the case diary in time to meet the Sr.APP/APP. The Investigating Officer should assist the APP in ascertaining from the witnesses what they would be stating in court, instructing him which documents are to be marked as prosecution exhibits and what items of property should be exhibited  and  ensure  that  the  prosecution  is  presented  in  the  best  possible  manner.  The Investigating Officer should also make enquiries and furnish materials to the Sr.APP/APP for the cross-examination of  defence  witnesses.  In  regard  to  the  execution  of processes  and production of witnesses or documents in connection with any enquiry or trial, it shall be the duty of all the concerned police officers to render every assistance to the prosecuting agency. 

   174\. **Examination of Witnesses in Court** 

1. The  handling  of  witnesses  in  court  calls  for  a  technique  different  from  that employed in the interrogation of persons during an investigation. The Prosecutor aims at establishing the guilt of the person known to be the culprit as a result of the investigation. 
1. **Examination-in-chief, cross examination and Re-examination:** Examination of witnesses in court is governed by the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act. A witness  is  first  examined  by  the  party  that  calls  him  and  this  is  called  his examination-in-chief. The opposite party is then entitled to cross-examine him, after which he may be re-examined by the party calling him, if it so desires. Examination and cross-examination must relate to relevant facts, but the cross- examination need not be confined to the facts to which the witness testified in his examination-in-chief.  The  re-exanimation  should  be  directed  only  to  the explanation of matters referred to in the cross-examination. If, however, any new matter is, by the permission of the court, introduced in the re-examination, the opposite party may further cross-examine the witness upon that point. 
3. **Handling  of  the  witnesses  :**  It  is  essential  that  before  the  trial  of  inquiry commences, the Prosecutor in-charge of the case, must prepare his case and know what his witnesses are going to state in the court. He should, therefore, interview each witness well in time and ascertain from him the facts to which he would testify in the court and instruct him how he should behave in the court. He should be  cautioned  keep his  temper,  to  answer  questions  distinctly and  in  a natural manner, and not to volunteer more information than is asked of him. A timid or nervous witness would need encouragement, while a self-opinionated, loquacious one must be warned against making his answers unnecessarily long or speaking about matters regarding which he has not been questioned. 
3. During  this  preliminary  interview,  the  Prosecutors  should  make  it  a  point  to anticipate questions which may be put to his witnesses in cross-examination and put those questions **to** the witnesses and find out what answers they have to give. This would help them to face the defence lawyers' cross-examination in court with  confidence.  There  should,  however,  be  no  attempt  to  tutor  witnesses.  A tutored witness is apt to perjure himself in court and damage even a good and true case. 
3. The  Prosecutor  must  not  produce  in  court  more  witnesses  than  are  actually essential to prove his case. No particular number of witnesses is required for the proof of any fact (Section 134 of the Evidence Act). It is the quality and not the quantity that matters. 
3. After  a  prosecution  witness  has  entered  the  box,  the  very  first  thing  that  the 

   Prosecutor should do is to put him at ease. It must be realised that few persons will  be  free  from  flurry  when  figuring  as  a  witness  in  court.  It  is,  therefore essential  that  the  Prosecutor  should  create  confidence  in  his  witness  by  his demeanour, by the form in which he frames his questions and by the manner in which he asks them. His tone should be modulated and reassuring. The witness should, as a rule, be permitted to tell his own story, but the Prosecutor should make  sure  that  all  important  facts  are  clearly  brought  out.  He  should  avoid technical terms as well as difficult and high-sounding words. 

7. The Prosecutor should handle his witnesses   according   to   their   nature. An overzealous, garrulous witness, for example, should never be allowed to tell his own  story,  for  by  so  doing,  he  is  likely  to  expose  himself  to  severe  cross- examination. The effort should be to keep* such a witness well to the point and compel him merely to answer the questions that are put to him. A stupid or timid witness will require great patience and good humour. Any display of anger will only add to his confusion. 

VIII.  **Leading questions :** It is a rule of evidence that no leading question should be put 

to a witness in the examination-in-chief, except with the permission of the court. This does not apply to matters* which are introductory or undisputed or which have been already sufficiently proved (Section 142 of the Evidence Act). In fact, questions in respect of introductory and undisputed matters are best asked in the form  of  leading  questions,  as  it  will  expedite  the  trial  and  tend  to  infuse confidence  in  the  witness.  When,  however,  the  main  issues  of  the  case  are reached, the rule against leading questions should be strictly adhered to, though, in exceptional cases, when ordinary questions have failed to elicit a detail the court may permit the Prosecutor to lead the witness to the extent necessary to make him recall the point omitted. 

9. **Hostile witness :** When a witness shows himself to be opposed to the side which has called him or adopts an attitude contrary to the truth, the court may, in its discretion, permit the side to treat him as a hostile witness and cross-examine him (Section 154 of the Evidence Act). But this permission will not be lightly given. The  general  attitude  of  the  witness  and  his  demeanor,  and  the  trend  of  his 

   evidence as a whole must indicate his hostility to his side or desire to conceal the truth.  If  the  court  gives  the  permission,  the  side  that  called  him  may  cross- examine him and may put him questions* to contradict him and impeach his credit. Section 154 of the Evidence Act does not in terms or by necessary implication, confines the exercise of the power of the court before the examination-in-chief is concluded or to any particular stage of the examination of the witness, but is wide in scope. The discretion is entirely left to the court to exercise the power, when circumstances  demand.  A  witness  who  has  deposed  favourably  or  not unfavourably to the case of the party calling him, may in the course of his cross- examination, show marked predilection to give answers sought or expected by the interrogator or otherwise disclose a hostile animus against the party calling him. A clever witness may in his examination-in-chief conform to what he has stated earlier to the police or in the committing court but in cross-examination introduce statements  in  a  subtle  way  contradicting  in  effect  what  he  has  stated  in examination-in-chief. The court can permit the prosecution to cross-examine such witnesses  under  Section  154  of  the  Evidence  Act  at  any  stage  of  their examination, as Section 137 of the Evidence Act, which lays down the sequence of examination-in-chief, cross examination and re-examination, has no relevance to the question as* to when a party calling a witness can be permitted to put to him questions under Section 154 of the 

10. **Cross examination :** The Prosecutor must closely follow the cross-examination of his witness by the opposite side, as that would often enable him to discover the accused's  line  of  defence.  He  must  take  exception  in  time  to  any  improper questions that might be put by the defence lawyer. Questions which assume facts to have been proved, which have not been proved or that particular answers have been  given  contrary  to  the  fact,  are  not  allowed  in  cross-examination.  An inveterate  abuse  is*  the  grouping  of  several  questions,  admitting  of  different answers into one long composite question and a demand of a categorical answer "Yes" or "No". With such a question, even a cool witness is misled and puzzled. Exception  should  be  taken  to  such  composite  and  answering  questions.  The Prosecutor should promptly decompose the composite question into several parts and put each part to the witness. 
11. If  the  Prosecutor  finds  that  any  of  his  witnesses  has  been  made  to  give  any* misleading statement or that any point has been purposely left obscure, he should clear it in re-examination. After the examination of his witnesses is over, the Prosecutor has to prepare himself for the cross-examination of defence witness to destroy  the  effect  of  the  evidence  tendered  on  behalf  of  the  opposite  side  in examination-in-chief. This may be achieved by discrediting the witness himself or his testimony. Leading questions are permissible in cross-examination. 
11. **Payment  of  expenses  to  the  witnesses  :**  Section  312  Cr.P.C.  provides  for payment of the reasonable expenses of any complainant or witness attending for the  purpose  of  any  inquiry,  trial  or  other  proceeding  before  such  court.  The prompt payment of the expenses of witnesses by courts will ensure the regular attendance of witnesses in criminal courts. The Prosecuting Officers concerned should, therefore, see that the expenses of witnesses attending the courts in the cases under their charge, as provided for in the said rules, are promptly paid by the courts. 

XIII.  **Impeaching the testimony of the witness :** The testimony of a witness may be 

impeached  by  showing  the  scanty  means  he  had  for  obtaining  the  correct knowledge of facts spoken to by him or by showing that, though he had the best possible  opportunity,  he  has  not  the  intelligence  necessary  to  observe  them correctly or the power of memory required to retain them so long. Again, two persons may witness an occurrence but give inconsistent versions of what they observed.  Further,  many  persons  enrich  their  personal  experiences  with  the fabrications of their imagination or with what they have heard from others. It is one of the objects of cross-examination to separate fact from imagination and the personal observation of the witness from that of others.  

14. The credit of a witness may be impeached:-                                                                                
1) by the evidence of persons who testify that they, from their knowledge of*  the witness, believe him to be unworthy of credit; 
1) by proof that the witness has been bribed, has accepted the offer of a bribe or has received any other corrupt inducement to give his evidence;  
1) by  proof  his  former  statements  which  are  inconsistent  with  his  present 

   evidence; and 

4) by showing, when a man is prosecuted for rape or an attempt to ravish, that the  prosecutrix was of generally immoral character. 
15. It is not necessary to cross-examine every witness. When the Prosecutor rises to cross-examine  a  witness,  he  should  first  ask  himself  the  questions,  "Has  the witness testified  to  anything that  is  materially against him? Is it necessary  to cross-examine him at all?". The cross-examination of a witness, when it is not really  necessary,  may  go  to  elicit  certain  facts  which  are  favourable  to  the opposite party. 
15. A skilful cross-examiner seldom takes his eyes from an important witness, while he is being examined by his adversary. His bearing, his manner of expressing himself, his movement of hands, all help any intelligent and experienced observer to arrive at an accurate estimate of his integrity. During the examination-in-chief of a defence witness, the prosecutor should always be on the alert for an opening for his cross-examination and should try to detect the weak spots in his narrative. 

XVII.  Bullying or threatening the witness seldom pays. It will often make the witness 

mentally defy the cross-examiner at once. If, on the other hand, the prosecutor's manner  is  courteous  and  conciliatory,  the  witness  will  soon  lose  the  fear  all   witnesses have   of the cross-examiner and can almost imperceptibly be induced into revealing true facts. The mistakes of a witness should be drawn out more often by inference than by direct questioning, because all witnesses have a dread of self-contradiction. The loquacious witness should be allowed to talk on and he will be sure to involve himself in difficulties. He should be encouraged and led by degrees into exaggeration that will conflict with common sense. The downright liar should be encouraged to exaggerate the way he thinks the Prosecutor does not want to him.  He will soon be found stretching his imagination to such an extent, that nobody will believe a word of what he says. 

XVIII.  If the manner of the witness and the wording of his testimony bear the marks of fabrication, it is often useful to ask him to repeat his story. He will usually repeat 

it in almost identically the same words as before, showing that he has learnt it by 

heart. Of course, it is possible, though not probable, that he has done this and is still telling the truth. An examiner should then test him by taking him in the middle of his story and jumping him quickly to the beginning and then to the end of it. If he is speaking by rote, he will be sure to succumb to this method. 

XIX.  If the Prosecutor obtains any favourable answer from a witness, he should leave it 

there and pass quickly to some other question. The inexperienced examiner who repeats the questions, with the idea of impressing the answer upon his hearers, will have to blame himself if the witness corrects or modifies his answer. 

175\. **Duties of Investigating Officers** 

1. On every date of hearing, the Investigating Officer should attend the court with the case diary files and assist the PP/APP/Senior APP in the conduct of the cases by giving him necessary instructions. If the Investigating Officer is not able to attend the court in the cases on any date of hearing, he should instruct his assistant (ASI or HC, as the case may be) to attend the court with the C.D. files, contact the P.P. and give necessary instructions.  
1. Where a case is adjourned for more than six hearings, an extra copy of the court C.D. should be made for the seventh and subsequent adjournments and sent to the SP/DCP concerned.   It shall be the responsibility of the SP/DCP concerned to examine such cases and take all necessary action for speedy disposal of the cases. 
1. Whenever a PSI/PI incharge of P.S. or a P.I. in charge of a Circle is transferred/ promoted, he should prepare a list of cases, which are pending trial in the courts in which he is the I.O./Witness and in which his evidence has not yet been taken. It  should  be  prepared  in  triplicate.  The  first  copy  should  be  sent  to  the Superintendent of Police of the district along with the charge report. The second copy should be kept in the PS/Circle Office in a separate file. The PSI/CI should carry with him the third copy and maintain it in a separate file in the PS/Unit to which he is transferred. 
1. A  Watch  Register  should  be  maintained  in  each  District  Police  Office.  The 

   Register should be written up as and when the list in Form, is received. It is the responsibility  of  the  Superintendent  of  Police  to  ensure  that  the  Investigating Officers attend the Courts on the dates of hearing. 

5. If there are several cases in which a police officer has to give evidence either as Investigating Officer or as witness, he should, in consultation with the APP so arrange the posting of cases that he is not summoned to court too frequently. During the monthly conference, the Unit Officers should ascertain from the SHOs the particulars of the cases in which the Investigating Officers have not appeared before  the  court,  and  pursue the  matter  to  ensure  their  appearance  before  the court. 
5. In the case of Investigating Officers who have been transferred out of the district, the  Superintendent  of  Police  should  arrange  with  his  counterpart  for  prompt attendance.  The  watch  register  should  be  kept  up-to-date  by  making  relevant entries. It should be referred to often, to ensure that Investigating Officers who stand transferred, attend the courts promptly on dates of hearing and have the cases disposed of by the courts as early as possible, so that within a reasonable time the Investigating Officers are relieved of their court duty arising out of work in their previous place of posting. If any Investigating Officer is absent before the court for two consecutive dates of hearing, the Superintendent of Police should write to the Range Inspector General, who in turn should ensure that the particular Investigating Officer attends the court. 

**How to Give Evidence in Court** 

176\. The following are some hints for the guidance of Police Officers in the matter of giving evidence in courts; 

1) Always appear in uniform when giving evidence in court; 
1) Always salute the court, when both entering and leaving the witness box; 
1) Be attentive, never fidget; 
1) Be calm and dignified while giving evidence, so as to impress the court and the counsel favourably; 
5) In giving evidence, look straight towards the court. 
5) When questioned by the adverse party, never turn   towards the   prosecution counsel. 
5) Answer no question without understanding it. If the question is not clear enough to be understood, say so and politely ask the counsel to repeat it in a simpler form. 
5) Do not answer a question with a counter-question. i 
5) If you do not remember any fact, say so at once rather than attempt a random answer. 
5) Never show irritation and do not be offended if the cross-examiner questions you in a way you do not like. 
5) If questions are unnecessarily vexatious or obnoxious, represent the matter to the court and seek its protection. Above all, do not quarrel with the counsel. 
5) Carefully distinguish between what you know personally and what you may have heard from others. 
5) In answering a question, do not give unnecessary information, for example, if asked whether the colour of a certain article is white, do not say "No, it is black", say simply "No" or "Yes". 
5) If you consider that some of your answer requires an explanation, which the counsel* failed to elicit, you may, when both the sides have finished, represent the matter to the court. 
5) Remember  that  all that the court wants to  ascertain  is  the guilt  or  innocence of  the accused and not your intelligence. 
5) Give no more details regarding the source of your information than from information received "I did this or that". 
5) Avoid lengthy answers, as they furnish more material for cross-examination. Your replies should be concise. 
5) Do not leave the court without its permission. 

**Enhancement of Punishment** 

177\. In every case in which an accused person previously convicted of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code with imprisonment of either description** for a term of three years or upwards, is prosecuted for an offence punishable under either of the two chapters with life imprisonment, the Prosecuting Officer concerned should, having regard to-** 

1) the nature and adequacy of evidence to prove in the Court of Sessions the offences** 

   committed by the accused; 

2) the interval between the date of the commission of the offence and date of release of the accused after his latest conviction and sentence; 
2) the total number of previous convictions; 
2) sentences awarded in the case of each previous conviction; and 
2) the fact whether the Magistrate before whom, the accused is charge-sheeted is competent to award an adequate sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offences and the accused's  previous  convictions  -  move  the  court  under  section  324  of  the  Code  of Criminal Procedure for committing the accused to the Court of Sessions for trial. 

**Prosecution of Witnesses for Perjury** 

178\. With a view to preventing witnesses intentionally giving false evidence and for the eradication of the evil of perjury, it is necessary to take action against such witnesses who 

turn hostile in the Courts. The Assistant Public Prosecutor should, in such cases, take action 

on the lines laid down in the following order:                                                                                              

1) When  a  witness  in  a  criminal  case  turns  hostile  to  the  prosecution  the  concerned         Assistant Public Prosecutions should, in the course of the cross-examination, lay a proper foundation  for  the  prosecution  of  the  witnesses  for  perjury,  strictly  complying  with  the provisions of Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act.                                                                                  
1) On  the  conclusion  of the trial,  the  Assistant  Public Prosecutor,  while addressing his argument on the merits of the case, should also emphasise on the necessity of prosecuting the witness for perjury.                                                                                                                                
1) If the court, at the time of delivery of the judgment or final order, does not record a 

   finding that in its opinion the witness has intentionally given false evidence and that for the eradication of the evils of perjury and in the interests of justice, his prosecution for perjury is 

   necessary and does not proceed under the provisions of Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecuting officer should carefully examine the judgment on the same day on 

   which it is pronounced.                                                                                                                                  

4) After examination of the judgment as aforesaid if the Prosecutor finds that judgment does not contain any finding under Section 340, he should immediately after the judgment and in consultation with his superintendent, present to the court, an application under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for taking action as provided therein and for instituting a complaint for perjury in a competent Court of Law.                                        
5) If,  after  such  application,  the  court  refuses  to  take  action  and  make  a  complaint  as provided  in  Section  340  of  the  Code,  a  copy  of  the  court  order  should  immediately  be obtained and the feasibility of appealing against it should be examined. In appropriate cases, appeals when justified should be preferred under Section 340 of the Code. 

   **Abscondence of Accused** 

   179\. An absconder is one who intentionally makes himself inaccessible to the process of law and it is not enough if it is shown that it was not possible to trace him soon after occurrence. It should be established that he was available at or about the time of the commission of the alleged offence and ceased to be available thereafter. For this purpose, the prosecuting officer conducting  the  case,  should  elicit  through  the  Investigating  Officer  and  also  the  Police Officers deputed to trace and arrest the absconder, evidence on the following points after citing them as prosecution witnesses, in addition to any other points on which evidence is necessary to prove such abscondence :- 

1) The residence and place where the absconder was living before the commission of the offence. 
1) The  place  and  places  he  was  ordinarily  visiting  before  the  commission  of  the  I        

   offence; 

3) His daily occupation and the place or places of his occupation. 
3) The names  and  addresses of  his  friends/relatives  he  was ordinarily frequenting,  etc., before the commission of the offence. 
3) Any   other   matters   relevant, which became known   during the course of investigation. 
3) The order Number and date issued to them under Section 55 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, directing them to trace and arrest the absconder. 

**Examination of Medical Officers** 

180\. The practice of summoning medical witnesses and making them wait for a long time in 

A the court without examination or sending them back without their evidence being recorded should be resisted. The prosecutor should take steps to promptly bring to the notice of the court the presence of the Medical Officers and request that the cases in which they have appeared may be taken up first so that they may be examined as soon as possible and enabled to return to their duties. The prosecutor should move the court for priority in that behalf. If, however, it is not possible to record their evidence on the days on which they are summoned to appear, they should be informed of it sufficiently early so that they may return to their duties in the hospitals immediately. A Medical Officer should not be made to appear in court more than once in the same case unless absolutely necessary and every step should be taken to see that on the day he appears, his evidence is completed and he is relieved of his duty in that case.  

**Summoning of Experts** 

181\. Only the experts cited in the charge sheet should be summoned to give evidence, the prosecutor should move the court well in time for the issue of process to the experts giving 

them sufficient time to adjust their programmes to attend the court on the dates fixed for their 

evidence.  Teleprinter  messages  should  not  be  sent  at  the  last  minute  to  get  the  expert 

witnesses to the court.                                                                                                                                    

182\. **Arguments and Summing up of the Cases** 

1) The prosecution consists of two distinct parts. The first is the presentation of evidence and the  other  is  the  summing  up  of  the  case  and  arguments.  Normally  the  contents  of  the arguments will be:-                                                                                                                            
1) Statement of the essential questions involved; 
1) Statement of quantum of proof required for proving the case; 
1) Statement  of  the  arguer's  evidence,  its  credibility,  probability,  probative  value  and* numerical preponderance, if any; 
1) Discussion  of  adversary's  evidence  to  show  its  weakness,  its  lack  of  credibility,  its insufficiency  because  of  its  inherent  weaknesses  or  lack  of  probative  quality,  and  its opposition to the greater weight or superior credibility or probability of the arguer's evidence; 
1) Applicability of facts to any points of law; and  
1) Discussion of relief. 
2) A good argument has the following characteristics; 
   1) Orderly presentation; 
   1) Balanced and well-proportioned length; 
   1) Courtesy towards court and opposing counsel; 
   1) Naturalness; 
   1) Earnestness and sincerity; 
   1) Maintenance of interest; 
   1) Use of plain and simple language; 
   1) Anticipation of adversary's arguments; and 
   1) Reply to adversary's arguments. 
2) The Prosecutor will have to prepare his arguments on the lines indicated above and present them in the best manner possible. 

183\. **Privilege in Respect of Official Records** 

1) The  law  relating  to  claiming  of  privilege  with  regard  to  records  and  production  of unpublished official records as evidence in courts is contained in Sections 123, 124 and 162 of the Indian Evidence Act, which are reproduced below; 
   1) "123. No one shall be permitted to give any evidence derived from unpublished records relating to any affairs of State, except with the permission of the officer at* the head of the department concerned, who shall give or withhold such permission as he thinks fit. 
   1) "124. No public officer shall be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official  confidence,  when  he  considers  that  the  public  interests  would  suffer  by  the disclosure. 
   1) "162. A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to court, notwithstanding any objection, which there may be to its production or to its admissibility. The validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the court. 
1) "The court, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine its admissibility. 
1) If, for such a purpose, it is necessary to cause any document to be translated, the court 

   may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the document is to be given in evidence; and if the translator disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have 

   committed an offence under Section 166 of the Indian Penal Code. 

4) The mere fact that the officer at the head of the department concerned does not wish the documents  to  be  produced  is  not  an  adequate  justification  for  taking  objection  to  their production.  Production  of  documents  should  be  withheld  only  when  the  public  interest would, by their disclosure be injured, or where disclosure would be injurious to national defence or to good diplomatic relations or where the practice of keeping a class of documents secret is necessary for the proper functioning of the public service. Privilege is not to be claimed on the mere ground that the documents are State documents or are official or marked confidential  or  that  their  disclosure  would  result  in  parliamentary  discussion  or  public criticism  or  would  expose  inefficiency  in  the  administration  or  tend  to  lay  a  particular department of the Government open to a claim for compensation. 
4) It has been held that it is desirable, but not indispensable, that the records should be sent in  a  sealed  cover  through  an  officer  of  the  department  claiming  privilege  and  that  the statement of the head of the department would be considered conclusive and the privilege upheld, except for compelling reasons to the contrary. So, the safe working principle under Section 123Cr.P.C. is to produce the records in question in a sealed cover and raise the claim of  privilege, setting out  the  grounds in  an  affidavit.  The  court will generally  accept the statements in the affidavit and uphold the privilege claimed.          
4) A  Government  Servant  other  than  the  head  of  a  department,  who  is  summoned  to 

   produce an official document, should first determine whether the document is in his custody and he is in a position to produce it. In this connection, it may be stated that all official records are normally in the custody of the head of the department and it is only under special circumstances that an official document can be said to be in the custody of an individual Government  Servant.  If  the  document  is  not  in  the  custody  of  the  Government  Servant summoned, he should inform the court accordingly. If, under any special circumstances, the document is in the custody of the Government Servant summoned, he should next determine whether  the  document  is  an  unpublished  official  record  relating  to  affairs  of  State  and whether privilege under Section 123 should be claimed in respect of it. If he is of the view that such privilege should be claimed or even if he is doubtful of the position, he should refer the matter to the head of the department who will issue necessary instructions and will also furnish the affidavit. The Government servant, who is to attend a court as a witness with official documents should, where permission under Section 123 has been withheld, be given an affidavit duly signed by the head of the department. He should produce it when he is called upon to give his evidence derived therefore. He should, however, take with him in a sealed cover the paper, which he has been summoned to produce. 

7) A Government Servant who is summoned to produce an official communication, which is made to him in official confidence, should first determine whether the public interests would suffer by its disclosure. If he considers so, he should claim privilege under Section 124. In case of doubt, he should seek the advice of the head of the department. When he is not attending the court himself to give evidence, he shall have the claim of privilege The person through whom the document is sent to court, should submit the affidavit to the court when called upon to produce the document. He should take with him the document which he has been called upon to produce but should not hand it over to the court unless the court directs him  to  do  so.  In  such  a  case,  privilege  should  be  claimed  under  Section  124  and  the document should not be shown to the opposite party nor should it be marked as exhibit in any proceedings. If the document is not in his custody, he should inform the court accordingly. 
7) The basic principle for deciding whether a particular document is a communication made in official confidence to a public officer or not, is whether the document produced or the statement made was under the process of law or not. If the former is the case, it would be difficult to say that a document produced or statement made under the process of law is a communication made in official confidence. If on the other hand, a document is produced or a statement is made in a confidential departmental enquiry not under the process of law but for the gathering of information by the department for guiding them in the future action, if any, they have to take, it would be a case of communication made in official confidence. The question whether a communication was made in official confidence is for the court to decide but  the  public  officer  concerned  is  the  sole  judge  whether  it  should  or  should  not  be disclosed. 
7) The head of the department should abstain from entering into correspondence with the presiding officer of the court concerned in regard to the grounds on which the documents have been called for. He should obey the court's orders and should appear personally or arrange for the appearance of another officer in the court concerned with the documents and act in accordance with these orders. In case of doubt, the head of the department should 

   invariably refer to Government for orders. 

   **Action on Breach of a Security Bond** 

   184\. When a person on a security of any kind is prosecuted for an offence involving a breach of the conditions of the bond, report in that regard should be made to the court in writing so that it may, in the event of conviction, order the confiscation of the security. 

   **Delay in the Disposal of Cases in Courts** 

   185\. Delays in the disposal of criminal cases are mainly caused by -                              

1) piecemeal examination of witnesses and failure to hear the case, as far as practicable, from day to day, and  
1) absence of police or prosecuting staff or witnesses on the date fixed for hearing.  

   **Police officers to be punctual, vigilant and responsible with regard to trial** 

   186\.  Police  Officers  should  be  punctual  in  attending  court.  If  the  Sub-Inspector  is unavoidably detained on any other important work, he should arrange to send one of his Head constables with the case diary to attend the court in time. There can generally be no excuse for* the absence of the prosecuting officers, as dates of hearing are fixed by courts in consultation with* them, having due regard to their work in other courts. Reasonable time should be allowed for service of summons issued by courts, and Police officers on their part should see that summons are served on the witnesses and they appear in court on the date fixed for hearing in addition to* returning the served summon's to the court at least a day before that date. Action should also be taken under Section 174 of the Indian Penal Code against  the  witnesses  who  fail  to  attend  the  court  in  spite  of  the  service  of  summons. Pendency can be considerably reduced and disposal of cases expedited by co-operation with the magistracy.                                                                            

   **Pendency of Cases With Magistrates** 

   187\. It is the responsibility of the Circle Inspector and the Station House Officer to take steps to obtain details of pending proceedings in all cases from Magistrates. While discussing Pendency in courts with Inspectors during the monthly crime meeting, the Superintendent will also ensure that details of all pending proceedings have been obtained from courts. 

   188\. **Issue of Summons** 

1. According to section 69 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, a court issuing a summons to a witness may, in addition to and simultaneously with the issue of such summons, direct a copy of the summons to be served by registered post addressed to the witness at the place where he ordinarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. When an acknowledgement purporting to be signed by the witness or an endorsement purporting to be made by a postal employee  that  the  witness  refused  to  take  delivery  of  the  summons  has  been received,  the  court  may  declare  that  the summons  has been  duly served.  The police officers should make use of this provision and arrange to request the court for sending the summons by registered post where necessary. 
1. According  to  section  206  of  the  Code  of  criminal  Procedure  1973,  if  in  the opinion of a Magistrate taking cognizance of a petty offence, the case may be summarily  disposed  of,  the  Magistrate  shall  issue  summons  to  the  accused requiring him either to appear in person or by a pleader before the Magistrate on a specified date, or if he desires to plead guilty to the charge without appearing before  the  Magistrate,  to  transmit  before  the  specified  date  by  post  or  by messenger  to  the  Magistrate,  the  said  plea  in  writing  and  the  amount  of  fine specified in the summons or if he desires to appear by pleader and to plead guilty to the charge through such pleader, to authorise, in writing, the pleader to plead guilty to the charge on his behalf and to pay the fine through such pleader. 
1. According  to  section  253  of  the  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure  1973,  where  a summons has been issued under section 206 Cr.P.C. and the accused desires to plead  guilty  to  the  charge  without  appearing  before  the  Magistrate,  he  shall transmit to the Magistrate, by post or by messenger, a letter containing his plea and also the amount of fine specified in the summons. 

189\. **Filing Appeals and Revisions in Acquittal or Discharge** 

I  In every case ending in acquittal or where there is a conviction only for a minor offence, the accused having been acquitted of more serious offences in the court 

of any Magistrate, the Senior APP or the APP in charge of the said case should, within 15 days from the date of the judgment, obtain and submit a certified copy of the judgment along with his report indicating the reasons for filing or not filing an appeal to the Director of Prosecutions. He should endorse a copy of his report to the concerned DCP/Superintendent. If the Director of Prosecutions decides that an appeal should be preferred, he should obtain the complete record of the case together with a Memorandum of grounds of appeal within two weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of the judgment. 

II  In  every  case  in  a  Sessions  Court  ending  in  an  acquittal  or  where  there  is 

conviction only for minor offences, the accused having been acquitted of more serious offences, the P.P. should likewise within 15 days from the date of the judgment obtain certified copy of the judgment and forward it to the Director of Prosecutions with his report indicating reasons for filing or not filing an appeal. He should endorse a copy of his report to the concerned DCP/Superintendent. If the Director of Prosecutions decides that an appeal should be preferred, he should obtain from the Public Prosecutor the complete records of the case together with a Memorandum of grounds of appeal, within two weeks from the date of receipt of the copy of the judgment. 

III  The Director of Prosecutions shall forward the relevant papers and the certified 

copy of the judgment along with his recommendation, to the State Government in the  Department  of  Law  and  Parliamentary  Affairs,  The  said  department  after obtaining (he orders of the Government for filing an appeal, shall communicate the  order  to  the  State  Public  Prosecutor  with  copies  to  the  Director  of Prosecutions the Director General of Police and the concerned Superintendent of Police. It will thereupon be the responsibility of the Director of Prosecutions to supply to the State Public Prosecutor the necessary papers and other information to facilitate the filing of an appeal within the prescribed period of limitation. 

IV The procedure prescribed above for filing of appeals shall also apply to a proposal for filing any revision petition subject to the modification that the time allowed at each stage to forward the records is reduced to about half the time prescribed above.  However,  in  the*  light  of  modified  procedure  prescribed  by  the 

Government, every proposal for appeal etc., should be examined by the Deputy Director concerned in consultation with the Inspector General of the Range and forwarded  to  the  Director  who  shall,  after  consulting  the  Director  General  of Police, forward the final proposal to the Department of Law and Parliamentary Affairs. 

V  While the Prosecutor takes action to prefer appeal/revision in cases of acquittal/ 

discharge, or conviction for minor offence/s the accused having been acquitted of more  serious  offence/s,  the  concerned  DCP/SP  also  should,  simultaneously, initiate action to obtain a copy (uncertified) of the judgment in such cases with the help  of  the  Prosecutor  of  the  court  concerned,  examine  it  in  the  light  of  the Prosecutor's opinion and forward it to the concerned Deputy Director with his opinion,  for  filing  appeal/revision,  if  it  is  a  fit  case  for  appeal/revision.  This should be done within a week from the date of pronouncement of the judgment. If a revision is proposed to be filed, action should be taken immediately after the order is pronounced.

Chapter 165 

**Preventive Role of Police**  

**Introduction** 

190\. The twin important duties of police are: maintenance of order and preservation of law. Police are empowered to maintain law and order and prevent, investigate and detect crimes. Prevention, it is said, is better than cure. In support of the preventive role of police the popular saying explains that a stitch in time saves nine. Prevention of disorderly situations and that of crimes, therefore, is said to be a better strategy of policing the community.   

190\.1 Law empowers the Police and the Executive Magistracy to prevent offences, breach of peace, and maintain public order. These powers inter alia include preventive arrests, security proceedings, removal of public nuisances, prohibitory orders and also deal with disputes that threaten peace. The powers are meant to provide a sense of safety, security and confidence in all sections of society. Prevention is as important as punitive action. 

**Preventive Police Methods and Mechanisms**  

191\. There are a number of methods, strategies and mechanisms used and utilized by the police for preventing law and order situations and crimes. Some of the important ones are following: 

1) Legal provisions 
1) Beats, Patrols, Gust, Nakabandi, Ambush etc. 
1) Police records 
1) Surveillance  
1) **Legal provisions** 

Various provisions have been made in CRPC, IPC and other special and minor Acts, which give powers to police to prevent offences and contain law and order situations. Some of the important provisions in the CRPC pertaining to such powers are following: 

1) **Unlawful Assemblies:** Section 129 empowers any SHO or police officer not below the rank of SI to command any unlawful assembly to disperse, and if it does not disperse, to use 

165

such force as may be necessary and also effect arrest. The powers conferred on the Police under this provision are both preventive and punitive. 

2) **Prevention of cognizable offences:** Every police officer should take steps to prevent cognizable  offences  and  for  this  purpose,  he  is  empowered  to  arrest  any  person  as  a preventive measure (151 CrPC) but a person who is arrested shall not be in custody  for more than 24 hours unless a specific offence is made out in the meanwhile. Likewise,** Section 41 CrPC empowers a police officer to arrest any person without warrant in certain cases.** 
2) **Preventive Action by Seizure:** As per section 95 CrPC, a police officer is empowered to seize any news paper, book or document, the publication of which is prohibited by a notification  of  the  government  on  the  ground  that  such  publication  is  punishable  under section 124A, or 153A, or 292, or 293, or 295A of IPC. 
2) **Urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger:** According to Section 144 of CrPC a  District  Magistrate,  Sub-Divisional  Magistrate  or  any  other  Magistrate  especially empowered by the State Government may, where immediate prevention and speedy remedy is desirable, by an order in writing direct any person to abstain from certain act or to take certain order with respect  to property in his possession  or  management. The ground for making such an order is that it is likely to prevent obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed or danger to human life, health or safety or a disturbance of public tranquility or a riot or an affray. The order can be either prohibitory or mandatory. The orders issued under the section are to remain in force for not more than two months and with State Government notification for another six months. The order can be issued ex-parte and can be directed against a person or persons residing in a locality or public generally when visiting frequently a particular area. The order under this section is an executive order. 'Curfew' orders are issued under this section only. 
2) **Breach of peace on account of disputes over immovable property**: Section 145 applies when there is a genuine dispute between two parties relating to immovable property and there is an imminent threat to peace. The main feature of Section 145 CrPC is that there is a bonafide dispute regarding land or water or boundaries and there is likelihood of breach of peace. The Executive Magistrate may pass an order directing the parties to appear and after having heard them and perusing the respective records pass final orders. Section 146 contains power of attachment  and to  appoint  a receiver under certain  circumstances. Section 147 

166

relates to disputes that cause breach of peace relating to sea, land or water. Police must initiate action under this section when there is genuine dispute between the parties with equal claims and threat to peace is imminent. 

6) **Security  for  Good  Behaviour  and  Keeping  the  Peace:**  Section  106  of  the  CrPC provides that the Court of Session or Court of a Magistrate of first class may, at the time of passing sentence on a person convicted of certain specified offences or abetting any such offences as laid down under that section, order him to execute a bond for keeping the peace for any period not exceeding three years. If the conviction is set-aside on appeal or otherwise, the bond executed shall become void. An order under this section may also be made by an Appellate Court or by a Court, which exercises powers of revision. In appropriate cases the SHO  with  the  help  of  a  prosecutor  should  file  a  memo  in  the  court  immediately  after pronouncing the judgment and before passing the sentence mentioning the reasons for taking security. If satisfied the court may take security up to 3 years commencing from the date of release from imprisonment. 
6) **Security for breach of peace:** Preventive action can be taken U/s 107 Cr.P.C. by an Executive Magistrate, if he has information through police or otherwise that any person is likely to commit breach of peace or disturb the public tranquility or to do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquility and is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding. He may require such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond for keeping the peace for such period, not exceeding 1 year. The Magistrate can take action whether such person(s) is residing in his jurisdiction or committing breach in his jurisdiction residing elsewhere. Section 107 is an effective means for preventing breaches or disturbances of public tranquility in connection with  religious  processions,  communal  tensions,  festivals,  fairs,  elections,  caste  conflicts, political movements or other disputes between factions. It is not essential in every case that there should be two parties fighting against each other. It must however, be clear that a breach of the peace is imminent, unless averted by proceedings under the section.  

   Before launching proceedings the police shall gather evidence, oral and documentary, of persons (including police officers) acquainted with the circumstances of the case regarding the specific occasion on which the breach of the peace is anticipated, the existence of a cause, quarrel or other circumstance which is likely to lead to the breach and the period of its duration,  the  declaration  of  the  parties  indicating  their  determination  to  carry  out,  or  to prevent, certain things in connection with the subject matter of quarrel, the strength and following  of  the  party  or  parties,  and  attempts  made  for  conciliation,  with  their  results. Arrests cannot be made u/s 107 CrPC. Only a Magistrate can issue a warrant u/s 113 CrPC if breach of peace cannot be otherwise prevented. Where the Police Officer feels that arrest is necessary he should report the circumstances  to the Magistrate and obtain a warrant for arrest.  However  arrests  may  be  made  in  urgent  cases  under  section  151  CrPC,  in  the circumstances provided therein. Section 108 of CrPC is intended to demand security bonds for keeping good behaviour for a period not exceeding one year from persons who commit or about to commit offences under sections 124-A, 153-A, 153-B, or 295-A of IPC or criminal intimidation or defamation of a judge or an offence under section 292 IPC. The main test is whether the person has been disseminating the offending matter and whether there is any apprehension of the offence being repeated.  

   **(viii) Section 109 CrPC:** This section applies to such class of persons who are found taking precautions to conceal their presence with a view to committing cognizable offences. Both ingredients of concealment and with a view to committing cognizable offence should be present, before a person can be proceeded against u/s 109 CrPC. The object of the section is to frustrate the criminal designs before they are carried out. It provision is purely preventive and not punitive. The security bond for good behaviour can be taken under the section for a period not exceeding one year. Concealment of presence is different from concealment of identity. The police officer must also be able to distinguish between a guilty person and a timid person.  

9) **Section 110 of the CrPC:** The object of this section is preventive, and not punitive. The action is not intended as a punishment for past offences. It is aimed at protecting society from habitual  offenders,  desperate,  dangerous  characters  and  anti-social  elements  against  the perpetration of crimes. It is intended to curb the dangerous activities of hardened criminals and secure the interests of community from injury at their hands.  
9) **Preventive provisions in special and local Acts:** In addition to the preventive measures describe  in  the  CRPC,  various  special  and  local  Acts  also  provide  for  situations  and circumstances in which the police officer should initiate preventive action. The police officer should be well-versed with these provisions for exercising and initiating effective, preventive action as per the intention of the legislature and demands of each case. 
11) **Removal of Public Nuisances:** Section 133 CrPC empowers Executive Magistrate to deal with public nuisances either on receipt of report of a Police Officer or other information. The public nuisances that can be redressed and unlawful obstructions that can be removed from any public place could be the following: 
- Obstructions or nuisance to any public place, or way or channel lawfully used by the public. 
- The conduct of any trade or occupation or the keeping of any goods or merchandise injurious to the health or physical comfort of the community, including blaring of loudspeakers beyond the prescribed decibels of noise and prescribed time. 
- Construction of any building or disposal of any substance as is likely to occasion conflagration or explosion. 
- A building tent or structure or a tree as is likely to fall and cause injury to persons. 
- An unfenced tank, well or excavation near public way or place and 
- A dangerous animal requiring destruction, confinement or disposal 

The duties of police in this regard are to inform the concerned Execute Magistrate promptly, all the matters falling in the purview of section 133 CrPC, on the lines as indicated below. 

- The local Police, beat and patrol men are responsible for reporting such instances without any loss of time. 
- If any representation is made or information is received, it should be verified by a visit to the place by the Police Officers of the beat. 
- If  they  come  across  such  nuisances,  the  details  should  be  collected  including photographs or sketch of the place and submitted to the SHO. 
- Private litigation or private interest should not be the basis for action by the Police.  
- It is not necessary that there should be danger or inconvenience already existing to the public at large, but it is sufficient if there is likelihood of such a thing, being, caused. 
- The term public nuisance is defined in section 268 of 1PC, which can be adopted for the purpose of this section. Section 12 of IPC states that the term public includes a class or community residing in a particular area but that class must be numerically sufficient to be designated as such.  
- Action under this section is not barred by Environmental Protection Acts.  
- Untreated pollutants, dumping of solid wastes, letting out chemical substances, gases, 

  vapour or this section besides specific provisions of law attracts dust, husk etc. The concerned  agencies  also  have  powers  and  responsibility.  There  should  be  mutual liaison between police and concerned departments and agencies. 

2) **Beats, Patrols, Gust, Nakabandi, Ambush etc.** 
1. Out of the two principal police functions, that is, prevention and detection of crime,  the  prevention  work  must  take  precedence  over  detection.  Intimate knowledge of the conditions prevailing in the police station jurisdiction and of the  movements  and  activities  of  criminals  are  conditions  precedent  for successful execution of preventive role of police. To gain such knowledge, an efficient beat system is a primary necessity. 
1. Village   authorities   are   primarily responsible for reporting   crime   and supplying information about the movements of bad characters but it should be clearly understood that this does not take away the responsibility of the police for gathering information necessary for* the effective prevention and detection of  crime.  For  this  purpose  the  constables  should  visit  villages  only  under definite orders, for a definite purpose and for a specified period. 

**Meaning and objectives of Beats** 

192\. Beat means a segment or part of the jurisdiction of a Police Station consisting of a village or group of villages or a locality in a town/city. Each beat is serially numbered in a police station. Beat service means performance of any of the functions and responsibilities of the police officer assigned to the beat, in that beat area. The objectives of beat are:- 

- To provide police services within easy reach of the community; 
- policing of a  manageable  area  and households by specified Constables and Head Constables; 
- promote  awareness  and  thorough  understanding  of  the  policing  needs  of  the community and of the law by the community; 
- promote  and  build  voluntary  and  participative  support  through  CLG/maithri committees/village officers and groups in preventive and detective work of police and protection of lives and properties and honour; 
- help understanding and reconciliation in caste, communal and group hostilities; 
- Gather, record and communicate information on crime, criminals, strangers, factions, organised criminal gangs, terrorists, anti-national and anti-social elements; 
- Provide day and night patrols to keep order, prevent crime, intercede when necessary; 
- maintain effective surveillance on history sheeted persons and ex-convicts; 
- arrest of persons in terms of section 41 CrPC;  
- preservation of crime scenes and assistance in investigation. 

193\. **Organisation of Beats: Selection and grouping of villages** 

1. The  beats  should  be  organised  taking  into  consideration  the  crime,  the vigilance required, factions prevailing, clandestine activities being organised in the area etc. The frequency of visits and period of stay depends upon the sensitive  or  hypersensitive  nature  of  the  area.  The  classification  keeps changing from time to time. The villages can be classified as sensitive or hypersensitive according to the existing crime and law and order situations and the past history of the concern village. 
1. All   the villages in the jurisdiction should be first classified as important, unimportant and deserted villages. These villages can be classified into A, B and C categories. Group of villages then should be grouped into various beats. Each beat will be properly defined and beat constables and beat supervisory officers  will  be  detailed  for  gust,  patrolling  and  collection  of  intelligence pertaining to each beat. The category of each village could be changed from time to time in the light of crime and law and order situations of each village. In the constitution of beats, geographical positions of villages should be the primary criterion.  A beat should not normally consist of too many Class A villages and these villages* should be situated so close to one another that a constable can visit  all  of  them  one  after  another  and  return  to  the station within a reasonable time. 
1. Special attention should be given to villages in which bad characters reside i.e., offenders, criminals, or members of organised crime gangs or syndicates or those who foment or incite caste, communal violence, for which history sheets are maintained and require surveillance, villages in which there have been in the immediate past frequent incidents or outbreaks of crime, either against persons or property, villages in which there are acute factions due to group rivalries, political, communal or caste or other tensions, and villages in which organised criminal or drug related activity or manufacture. Likewise the villages in which trafficking in firearms and movements of explosives exists or where there is possibilities of shelter being given to the terrorists and other organised criminals exist, should also be given special attention by the beat officers such villages. 
4. The beat visits should be organised on geographical proximity and also to arrange the visit of villages one after the other. A village, which is neither sensitive nor hypersensitive, but must be traversed en-route is called a route village. There may be one or more such villages in each beat. Their names have to be entered in the column entitled, "Route villages" in the beat book of that beat. 
4. The beats in an outpost or police station jurisdiction should not be more than 3 or 6 respectively, and not more than 8 in both put together. Each beat should cover approximately 1000 households or 7,500 populations. If a police station area has 40,000 or more population there should normally be six beats, with each  beat  covering  a  population  of  6000  -  10000  depending  on  factors mentioned above. Such other factors as most convenient, accessibility, road, rail,  network,  communication  facilities  and  the  number  of  sensitive  or hypersensitive  localities,  villages  should  also  be  considered.  Sensitive  and hypersensitive villages should be distributed in all beats and not grouped into one or two. A beat book will be maintained for each general beat. The crime chart should show the areas covered by and the serial number of each beat. 
4. The Sub-divisional Officer, during the annual inspections, must particularly ensure whether the beats have been organised conventionally and based on all relevant and realistic factors. He should personally tour in one or two beats along  with  SHO  and  the  police  officers  assigned  to  the  beat  in  the  same manner as a beat Constable does, to make sure that it is organised properly 

   and can be served in the manner prescribed. 

7. Two police officers i.e., either two police Constables or one Constable and one Head Constable should be allotted to each beat. They are responsible to visit and patrol sensitive village. The hyper-sensitive villages should be more frequently visited. It is not necessary that all villages in a beat should be covered  every  time  the  constables  go  to  that  beat.  They  should  cover  the villages in the beats at least once a week not only in the day time but also at nights. They shall proceed on beat duty at least 4 times in a month, each visit being spread over at least two days and one night. The SHO should ensure that they are not allotted any other duty in the PS when the Constables/HCs in charge of a beat proceed on beat duty once a week. The SHO may, however, earmark any two days or more if necessary to the Constables in charge of the beat to proceed to their respective beat areas to discharge their responsibilities and duties enumerated herein. The SHO should obtain prior permission for any deviation from this from Inspector/SDPO. The Inspector shall surprise at least one beat in a PS in a month in addition to regular inspections. 

VIII.  Visiting villages and staying there is essential for efficient policing in a beat 

area. The smaller villages attached to larger village, should also be treated as a separate village for the purpose of village visiting or patrols either by day or night. All those areas constituted into Municipalities may be called Towns. Major  Municipalities  and  Municipal  Corporations  should  be  identified  as cities. 

IX.  The duration of the visit by the Constables and Head Constables during the beat in a village depends upon the purpose. Visits should include all hamlets 

and settlements or colonies. The SHO should visit villages as prescribed. The beat area constables and HC before leaving the PS for duty on their beats should make relevant entries as to the purpose and duration in the General Diary.  The  instructions  regarding  village  visiting,  maintenance  of  village roster by SHO and others contained in this Chapter and elsewhere should be read as part of this Order. Visits include patrol by day or night, besides other duties, should be for a specific purpose. They should neither be hurried nor- unduly prolonged. All visits and work accomplished should be reflected in the relevant records. 

**Duties of Beat Constable** 

194\. The Constables assigned to a beat should perform the following duties: 

- Identify  through  discreet  enquiry,  observation  and  verification  about  habitual offenders, specially dangerous criminals, the nature of crime they are addicted to, or gangs,  including  members  of  organised  crime  syndicates  requiring  surveillance irrespective of their area of operation; 
- Collect  information  from  or  about  travellers  at  camping  grounds,  choultries,  rest houses, railway premises, ferries and other places of public resort; 
- Ascertain or verify any definite piece of information concerning crime or criminals; Service of summons and execution of warrants. 
- Gather  Information  about  movement  of  bad  characters,  suspicious  strangers  and wandering gangs in the village; 
- Enquire the movements/both good and bad activities of all ex-convicts and history sheeted  persons  specially  with  reference  to  their  lavish  expenditure  or  of  other persons connected with them beyond their normal means; 
- Find out the existence of any receivers of stolen property, contacts by bad characters or strangers with them; 
- Identify  liquor  shops,  illicit  sources  of  liquor,  vice  dens,  gambling  houses,  drug peddlars, unlicensed weapons. 
- Collect  intelligence  about  agitational  activities  of  political  parties  or  other organisations  and  clandestine  activity  of  any  organisation  or  their  associates,  or members or supporters. 
- To notice and ascertain any fresh settlers in the village or visitors and the places from where they have arrived and their friends and relatives in the village with whom they are staying or providing support to them. 

**SHO to decide the interval of Beat visits** 

195\. The Station House Officer should decide the intervals at which he should send men on the different beats in his jurisdiction according to the importance of the beats. Constables should be deputed to beats as often as possible, visits to more important* beats being more frequent than to others. It is not necessary that all villages in a beat should be covered every time a constable is sent to that beat. This is a matter entirely within the discretion of the Station House Officer.   It should, however, be ensured by the Station House Officer that every village whether of Class A or B or C in the jurisdiction of the station is visited by a Beat Constable at least once a month.  

196\. **Constables to Know Each Beat** 

1. Every constable in the station should be fully acquainted with every beat and he should  know  about  suspicious  characters  and  undetected  crimes  of  each  beat. Whenever a constable is sent out on duty either on beat duty or any other duty, the Station House Officer should give specific instructions to the constable regarding such matters as the nature of the work he has to perform, the manner in which it should be performed and the time by which he should return to the Police Station.    
1. Constables going on beat duty will proceed to the beat direct from the Police Station. Likewise, on return they should report at the Police Station before going home. The departure of a constable on beat duty and the instructions given to him by the Station House Officer should be entered in the Station House Diary as well as in the Beat Book. Beats should be served not only in the daytime but also at nights.  
1. Beat constables should be instructed to visit Railway Stations and Bus Stands in their beat and ascertain from the Platform Constables or Bus Stand Duty Constables or from  others  any  information  regarding  the  arrival  or  departure  of  suspicious foreigners and bad characters and obtain the signature of the Platform Constable or Bus Stand Duty Constable or Bus Stand Duty Constable, where one is posted, in their Beat Books. 
1. It is incumbent upon the police to ensure the safety of the road and strict attention must,  therefore,  be  paid  to  road  patrolling.  Unduly  severe  work  should  not  be demanded from night petrol men. They should be sent out with definite orders which may be varied, as circumstances permit. It should always be possible to arrange for a patrol to take some rest at a named place If possible, two constables should patrol together.  To  secure  the  due  performance  of  road  patrolling,  constant  checking  is absolutely essential, and superior officers must see that a sub- ordinate officer, from Inspector downwards, perform their fair share of this duty.  
5. On the National Highway, the State Highways and other important roads on which the cases of Highway Robberies and Dacoitie are reported, arrangements have to be made for the movements of vehicles in a convoy with mobile armed escorts. Where mobile escort cannot be provided to the convoy of vehicles, armed men have be provided to the first and the lost vehicle of the convoy.  

**Beat Books** 

197\. Every beat including a miscellaneous beat should have a Beat Book. Constables going on a beat should take the Beat Book along with them and note in them, under appropriate columns, the information they gather. The signatures of at least two persons whose sample signatures are maintained in the station in the Sample Signature Book should be obtained by the  constables  in  the  appropriate  column.  Such  signatures  should  be  obtained  in  all  the villages including ' Route' villages through which the beat constables pass. If the signature of any of the persons could not be obtained the reasons therefore should be mentioned in the column. The Beat Book should be carried by the constable while on beat duty. Like  beat books,  Point  Books  should  be  supplied  to  the  village  officers  or  selected  respectable inhabitants of the respective village for ensuring cross checking of the visit made by the beat constable. Likewise, check register of bad characters, duty roster, village rosters etc. should be maintained by each police station with regard to effective and efficient performance of beat duties. 

198\. **Procedure On Return From Beats**

1. When  a  constable  returns  from  beat  duty,  he  should  report  to  the  Station  House Officer. An entry should be made about the time of return of the constable from beat duty  in  the  Station  House  Diary.  The  Station  House  Officer  should  check  the signatures   in   the Sample Signature Book in the Station. 
1. The Station House Officers should carefully seek report from the constables on their 

   return from beat to elicit any information they have obtained.  Constables should be sent out with specific orders and questioned as to the performance of their duty on their return to the Police Station. This duty is not to be delegated to the subordinate officers Station House Officers should deal with it themselves. 

3. The information brought by the constable should be studied and appropriate action taken. For example, if a bad character is reported to be absent from his village and the place  to  which  he  has  gone  is  known  an  Enquiry  Roll  Form  'A'  will  be  issued immediately to the Station House Officer to whose jurisdiction the bad character is reported to have gone. If the place to which the bad character is reported to have gone is within the jurisdiction of the same Police Station, a Constable or a head Constable will be sent out to the place to ascertain the movements and activities of the bad character.  It  must  also  be  seen  whether  the  absence  of  the  bad  character  has synchronised  with  the  occurrence  of  any  crime  in  the  limits  of  the  station  or neighbouring stations.  

**Checking of Beats** 

199\. The Station House Officer/Police Sub-Inspectors, Assistant Sub-Inspector and Head Constables should check the constables on beat duty by surprise. The Circle Inspector who is the Station House Officer, Police Sub-Inspectors or Head Constable should visit selected villages with the Beat Books and compare the dates and hours of the entries in the Beat Books  with  those  in  the  Point  Books,  Such  verification  should  be  made  even  when  the Station House Officer or a Head Constable goes to a village on any other work, such as petition enquiry or investigation. If Beat Books are not available the checking officer will note down the particulars in his note book and compare them with the Beat Book on his return to the station. The Circle Inspector and the Station House Officer should also make enquiries with the villagers other than Point Book holders about the beat constable's presence on the days noted in the Beat Book. The Station House Officer should be able to check all the beats in the limits at least once a month. The Police Sub-Inspectors, Assistant Sub-Inspectors and Head Constables should do so more often. The Police Inspector/Police Sub-Inspector in charge of the Police Station should ensure that he visits every village in his jurisdiction at least once a quarter.  

**Duties Of Supervising Officers In Relation To Beats** 

200\. Officers of and above the rank of Circle Inspector visiting or inspecting a station should not only see whether beat villages have been properly selected but also ensure that beats are being regularly served and checked. The fact of having done so should be embodied in the inspection notes together with the instructions, if any, given to the Station House Officer. 

3) **Police records** 
1. Police records, pertaining to crimes and criminals and the ones maintained at the police station and various other places with regard to law and order situations, play a vital role and assist the police personnel in a meaningful way in the discharge of their duties with regard to prevention of crimes and law and order situations. 
1. Police records perform the role of broad database and on the basis of information available in this database police officers can devise methods and plan out for keeping  check and control on the movements and activities of the criminals, and at the same time can also keep a track on the emerging law and order situations. The information available in the police record would help the police officers in making preventive arrests  and  evolving  other  strategies  for  prevention  of  crimes  and  law  and  order situations. 
1. With the advent of computer technology and adoption of computerization at various levels, the record keeping has become more systematic, scientific and organized. A large bulk of records can be maintained by use of computers and even the retrieval of the desired record is also quick and fast. The computerization of police records thus should be gainfully utilized by the policemen of various ranks for the discharge of their prevention duties. 
4) **Surveillance**  

Surveillance is a vital part of preventive action by police. It deters the designs of a person intending  to  commit  offences.  The  nature  and  degree  of  surveillance  depends  on  the circumstances and persons on whom surveillance is mounted. It is only in very rare cases and on rare occasions that round the clock surveillance becomes necessary for a few days or weeks. It is necessary that those who deserve to be kept under close surveillance receive maximum attention.  

201\. **Surveillance of HS and BC** 

1. The  beat  Police  Officers  should  be  fully  conversant  with  the  movements  or changes of residence of all persons for whom history sheets of any category are maintained.

The SHO on this basis of information should  report  by  the  quickest  means  to  the  SHO  in  whose  jurisdiction  the concerned  person/persons  are  going to  reside or  pass  through.  The  SHO who receives  the  first  communication  should  acknowledge  the  communication  and inform the concerned beat Police Officers of the area. If the subject is moving out to another area he should initiate the same procedure of intimating the concerned SHO.  The  receiving  officer  shall  acknowledge  the  first  and  second communications. When replies are received the SHO shall make necessary entries in the history sheet and records.

If  the suspicious stranger states that he resides in another State, a BC Roll shall be sent directly to the SHO of the station in the other State. 
1. **Bad characters going out of view:** When a BC absents himself or goes out of view, whether wanted in a case or not, the information should be disseminated to the police stations having jurisdiction over the places likely to be visited by him 

   and also to the neighbouring stations, whether within this State or outside. If he is traced and intimation is received of his arrest or otherwise arrangements to get a complete and true picture of his activities should be made and the concerned record updated. 

5. **Transfer of criminals to jails of native place:** All dangerous convicts should be transferred to the jails near their native places, 2 months before their release.

5. **Release of Foreign Prisoners:** Before a foreign prisoner whose finger prints are taken for record is released the SP of the district where the case is registered should send a report to the Director, I.B. through CID informing the route and conveyance by which he is likely to leave this country. 
5. **Shadowing of convicts and dangerous persons:** The following are the rules for shadowing the convicts on their release from jails. 
1) Dangerous convicts who are not likely to return to their native places should be shadowed. The fact, when a convict is to be shadowed shall be entered in the DCRB in the FP register and communicated to the Superintendent of Jail.

Chapter 184 

**Maintenance of Law & Order** 

**Introduction** 

202\. Preservation of peace and maintenance of order in the society is the primary and basic duty of the police department. Peace and development go hand in hand. If there is peace, tranquility and order in the society, development and progress of various sorts take place in a natural  way.  On  the  contrary,  if  there  is  an  atmosphere  of  disorder,  disturbance  and uncertainty, the overall development of the society will be a natural casualty. In a democratic society freedom of expression is a fundamental right, and at the same time in a plural society like India, there is every possibility of difference of opinion and consequent the dissention in the opinions, values and thoughts is likely to cause confrontation and conflicts among various groups. Such situations, if not regulated, controlled and contained, they are likely to create serious situation of law and order. 

**Law & Order : Concept and Dimensions** 

203\. The field police officers should realize that society is full of factors and potentials which might cause disruption to normal peaceful conditions. Police, therefore should always keep a close watch on various social, political, economic, religious, cultural and other activities and issues so that these might not take an ugly turn and convert themselves into situations of law and order. All activities though normal may obtain abnormal dimension, and might cause breach of peace and tranquility to create a situations of law and order for the police. The concept of law and order, therefore is based primarily on the presumption that any normal situation,  by  seen  or  unseen,  sudden  or  deliberate,  accidental  or  intentional  reason  can become  abnormal  and  thereby  obtain  a  dimension  of  ordinary  or  serious  law  and  order situation. The concept of law and order is a multi-faceted and multi-dimensional nature. The police, therefore, are required to handle a large variety of law and order situations including student unrest, political agitation, social demonstration, cultural and religious processions, industrial agitation, various types of strikes, Dharnas and Gheraos etc. Each of the above categories of law and order situation would have its own specific and special contexts and the police will have to tackle it accordingly. 

184

**Perspectives on Law and Order** 

204\. Riots and other disturbances take place due to socio-economic and political frictions, communal, caste, regional, industrial, agrarian and political disturbances. Criminal, goonda gangs  and  unsocial  elements  provoke  these  disturbances  and  add  fuel  to  the  fire.  The disturbances cause widespread panic, physical assaults, bodily injuries, murders, lootings, rapes and forcible closure of business establishments and shops and may create situations of intimidation. There inhuman acts take place posing a challenge to the efficacy of the police and the good governance of the government in dealing with these disturbances. Police have an onerous and difficult duty in tackling such situations with all the legal means available at their command.  

**Riots** 

205\. No crime is so dangerous to the peace, harmony, life and well being of the people as riots. Widespread riots for any duration paralyse trade, free movement of people depriving their normal means of livelihood shaking the confidence in the police and the government. It is the prime duty of the police to prevent the commission of breach of peace by gathering intelligence to nip it in the bud. The police may later have to take effective measures in controlling the disturbances. Primarily, it is the duty of the law and order police to control these disturbances as per situation with the assistance of other wings of the department like Reserve Police, Railway Police, Spl. Police, Central Paramilitary Forces etc. as per the need. Each situation calls for different ways of dealing and adopting measures suiting to the laws and the needs. 

**Collection of Information** 

206\. Police should collect information about every movement, state of feeling, dispute or incident, which may lead to a breach of peace. Communication of such information should be sent to the concerned authorities for taking action and to use the information for the purpose of preventing or detecting the associated crimes and for preventing breach of peace. All police measures and actions, their efficacy and use depend on the quality of intelligence gathered and its use.**  

207\. **Police Action at the Grass Root Level** 

185

1. Consult police station records to identify the occasions of breach of peace, its nature, the  places  and  potential  troublemakers.  The  records  should  be  kept  accurate  and updated, 
1. Visit the place and assess public feeling and likely trouble and contact persons who command respect and confidence of rival groups. Also gather information from all possible sources. 
1. Understand and follow thoroughly the communications and instructions from superior officers. Share this with the staff and ascertain full details from beat police and other police staff on all aspects. 
1. After the evaluation and assessment of the problem in all its aspects with reference particularly to the persons, places and nature of trouble, police officers should decide on surveillance, preventive arrests, promulgation of regulatory or prohibitory orders, arrangements to be made to contain and control trouble.  
1. It is the prime duty of the police to prevent the commission of cognizable offences. They should enlist the assistance of influential persons in communities in mitigating the situation and see that they exercise their influence in controlling the situations.  
1. Policemen on duty should be instructed to take help of village officials and keep vigil and  report  from  time  to  time  on  the  meetings,  both  public  and  secret,  handbills distributed and rumours set afloat by mischievous local elements or outside agents. 
1. A striking force of adequate police strength should be mobilized and kept ready for attending  to  any  sudden  out  break  of  mob  violence.  Besides  this  all  riot  control equipments like water cannon, gas guns, firearms and ammunition, helmets, shields, tear gas shells, shock batons, baton rounds (rubber/plastic bullet), lathis etc. should be kept ready for use. 
1. Precautionary measures for preventing or dealing with such disorders depend-upon a number of factors, including the cause of friction, the nature of the particular dispute,  whether  the   danger   is   continuous   or  associated   with  a  particular  festival  or occasion, and the influence of the leader of the communities.  
1. Experience has shown that precautions taken in proper time tend to inspire confidence among several communities and check the misguided zeal of irresponsible elements.  
1. Arrange   frequent patrolling if assessment   reveals possible breach of peace.  
1. Precaution signals, police preparedness and timely action act as a deterrent to possible troublemakers and inspire confidence among public. 
1. Pay utmost attention to fasts, feasts and festivals of different communities occurring 

   at the same time. Work out mutually acceptable arrangements; reconcile conflicting approaches or disputes with the help of rival local leaders. But do not be misled by promises and assurances and make necessary arrangements as a precaution. 

13. Keep the concerned Executive Magistrate informed in writing to be available. Police Officers  should  remain  in  close  touch  with  the  magistracy  during  situations  of anticipations and actual breach of peace. 
13. When tensions and feelings run high, a clash in a large town develops into serious and widespread trouble. Precautionary measures need to be taken on this assumption as such steps will prevent and stop clashes in other areas apart from containing spread of trouble. 

**Police Action if Situation Deteriorates** 

208\. If disorders get a firm foothold before the necessary arrangements are made to control and bring about normalcy, and if the trouble assumes the form of gang attacks, kill and run situations and the police are inadequate to prevent it, the following measures should be taken. 

1. Promulgation of orders under section 144 CrPC including curfew, prohibiting the holding  of  meetings,  delivering  of  speeches,  assembling  of  persons,  carrying  of weapons, taking out processions, or other acts from which a breach of the peace can be apprehended. 
1. In case of disputes that occasion the breach of the peace relating to land or water or to boundaries of land or water, action under sections 145 to 148 of CrPC is appropriate and must be taken. Copies of reports to Magistrates for action u/s 144 or 145 of CrPC should be sent to the concerned superior Police Officers. 

209\. **Further Police Action** 

1. If  the  prospect  of  averting  trouble  is  not  encouraging,  concentrate  a sufficiently large police force in the vicinity of the scene of trouble. But where trouble  is  anticipated  a  show  of strength,  is  sometimes  sufficient to  avoid untoward developments. The police force should be strong enough to deal promptly and effectively with major or minor incidents. Route marches by police columns through the affected areas help in containing and the spread of incidence. Arrangements must be made for patrols and pickets and for the establishment of communications between the various police parties and the police headquarters. 
2. The deployment in such situations should be to contain large-scale trouble and quick  return  to normalcy. Hence  aimlessly scattering  and thinning  out  the police force should be avoided otherwise it may result in not being able to prevent  anything  anywhere.  All  deployment  should  ensure  communication between all pickets, patrols and striking forces both in terms of equipment and physical mobility between each point. In short physical contact by foot or transport  should  be  ensured  between  one  point  and other  when police  are deployed.  
2. SDPOs, SP/Addl. SP should be present at the scene of the trouble and should not leave the situation to be handled by subordinates alone without taking away initiate from them. Mobile patrols in a vehicle with a Magistrate and motorcycle patrols in a town are more valuable form of patrol in a town or city. 
2. Precautionary measures should include action u/s 151 CrPC against goondas, rowdies,  suspects,  bad  characters  and  the  persons  likely  to  create  trouble. Since the effect of an arrest u/s 151 CrPC is only for 24 hours. A specific offence must be made out in case a person is required to be kept in custody for more than 24 hours. 
2. In  respect  of  breach  of  peace  due  to  communal,  caste  or  other  problems, preventive detention can be resorted to. When public property is destroyed in the course of riots or agitations action can be taken under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act 1984.    

210\. **Dispersal of Unlawful Assembly** 

1. For the dispersal of unlawful assemblies by use of force 3 important conditions should be fulfilled. (1) that there is an unlawful assembly; (2) such an assembly is ordered to disperse; and (3) in spite of the orders the assembly refused to disperse. The  force  to  be  used  should  be  minimum  required  to  disperse  the  unlawful assembly. The quantum of minimum force differs from situation to situation and depends on the nature of crowd and its activities etc. 
2. There will be salutary effect if arrests of those responsible are made immediately on the spot. Where the clash takes the form of mob fighting, there should be no hesitation to disperse it by effective use of force. Use of firearms should be the last resort, when all other measures have failed to save the lives and property of the people. However, the decision to open fire to control mob should be taken quickly and the situation should not be allowed to go out of hand due to in- decision or delay in taking decision to open fire. 

211\. **Riot Schemes and Police Action** 

1. A riot scheme should be drawn up for every important town for each category of riot  like  communal,  caste,  regional  or  political.  These  schemes  should  be practiced every half-year. The object of the practice is to ensure that all officers are conversant with the details of the scheme and their duties therein. 
1. Cases  must  be  registered  promptly,  investigated  impartially  and  prosecuted successfully under the close supervision of Inspectors and SDPOs. If need be, a separate investigation team should be formed during the period of riots. If there is a shortage of manpower, special police officers can be appointed under the Police Acts. 

**Action When Situation Under Control** 

212\. When the situation has been brought under reasonable control the following measures should be taken. 

1. Police  deployment  should  ordinarily  continue,  though  on  a  reduced  scale,  until confidence is restored. 
1. Orders passed under section 144 CrPC, may be continued for some time since this helps in preventing panic. 
1. If curfew has been imposed, a relaxation for a few hours depending on situation may be given to start with and later it can be gradually withdrawn when situation returns to normal. 
1. The assistance of non-officials is of greater value during the conciliation stage and it should be fully availed. 
5. Senior Police Officer must assess the situation promptly and leave the scene when they  are  fully  satisfied  that  the  situation  is  brought  under  control  without  taking complacence haphazardly. 
5. Case reported during riots should be promptly investigated and finalised. 

**Legal Provisions to deal with Law & Order Situations**  

213\.  Police  Act  empowers  DSsP  and  above  to  notify  requiring  licence  by  all  persons conducting a meeting or a procession in public places or thoroughfares. If the authority is of the opinion that such assembly or procession if uncontrolled is likely to cause a breach of the peace, they can issue notice requiring licence by any assembly or procession for the use of music. As per the direction of Government, such order shall specify the duration for which the  licence  is  required.  A  procession  or  an  assembly  which  violates  the  conditions  of  a licence may be ordered to disperse. If the procession or the assembly so ordered to disperse neglects or refuses to obey the order, it shall be deemed to be an unlawful assembly. 

214\. **Instructions for Officers With Regard to Processions** 

1. The  enforcement  authorities  should  play  an  impartial  role  in  implementing  the respective right of the parties. 
1. If it is apprehended that the enjoyment of the approved practice with respect to any procession will lead to a breach of the peace, it is the duly of the officers concerned to take adequate precautionary measures.  
1. Leaders of factions should be involved from the beginning in the maintenance of order.  Help of citizen Committees should be solicited. 
1. Any  newspapers  carrying  on  negative  propaganda  should  be  cautioned  against indulging in any action likely to disturb peace. All relevant material and its effects should be kept ready to face the challenge to such actions in courts. Freedom of press (expression), a right guaranteed under the Constitution should be respected. But the restrictions if any imposed on such right should be implemented. It should be borne in mind that flow of proper information to the public through press may also bring down tensions and help in restoring normalcy. Hence all Police Officers should assess the situation  in  its  entirety  and  make  proper  use  of  the  media  to  restore  peace  and confidence. 

**Industrial Unrest** 

215\. The following orders should be followed by the police on the occurrence of trouble among the workers during strikes or widespread unrest. 

1. Labour  problems  are  due  to  economic  reason,  unresolved  disputes  between management  and  labourers  or  due  to  vested  interests  and  issues  raised  by  trade unions. When a strike or a situation that disturbs peace actually occurs, the duty of the police is only to preserve peace and not to interfere in or arbitrate on the issues involved.  There  are  several  departments  under  various  laws  to  deal  with  such disputes. Police are concerned only in prevention of violent activities and destruction of properties. They should however; activise the labour and individual department officials  to  initiate  measures  for  solution  if  they  feel  that  clashes  or  undesirable activity may result in deteriorating law and order. 
1. Timely information on the industries, the subsisting disputes with potential for law and order problems, the likely trouble makers, and the nature of violence that may be caused should be gathered by police.* 
1. The police should prevent breaches of the peace, secure the safety of property, and general public, deal with and investigate cognizable cases, and obtain information all other related points  
1. The SHO should inform the Inspector, SDPO and the SP at the earliest about the possibility of a strike and give intimation immediately on its occurrence. The report should contain details of the number of persons affected, the issues involved in the strike and the extent of disorder anticipated. Should the police force of the area be insufficient to cope with the situation, the SP should requisition additional strength from other sources. 
1. Peaceful  picketing  to  prevent  non-strikers  from  attending  or  resuming  work  by persuasion, as distinct from force or intimidation, or wrongful restraint, is not an offence, and does not call for police interference, but it only needs watchfulness and regulation of the situations. 
1. Gherao and obstruction constitute offence, particularly when these activities assume violent  or  abusive  shape  necessitating  police  intervention.  Police  should  make arrangements  to  cover  demonstrations,  hartals  etc.  so  that  they  can  intervene effectively. When information about the Gherao is received the police must rush to the place so that the person restrained is set free.  
1. In  dealing  with  violent  situations  inside  a  factory,  particularly  containing 

   sophisticated machinery or chemical substances the help of the officers should be secured. The industrial security personnel, or others posted for security would be in the best position to provide necessary assistance to the police in dealing with the situation. Close liaison should therefore be maintained with them. 

8. Destruction   of public property or physical harm to persons, violent demonstrations in the factory or outside should be dealt with in accordance with law.  
8. The  police  must  be  aware  of  the  right  to  protest  for  seeking  solution  of  labour problems  in  accordance  with  law.  However,  they  should  keep  themselves  fully informed of the situation so as to act in time wherever violence is likely. 

216\. **Law & Order due to Factions**  

1. The  frequent  occurrence  of  factious  riotings  in  certain  areas  of  the  state  is  a definite indication of the challenges, which the police have to face in controlling factious crime effectively. Attention should be paid to factious villages and all steps  appropriate  should  be  taken  to  prevent  factious  crimes.  Impartiality, integrity, promptness and firmness are the most essential qualities required of a police officer in dealing with factions and investigation of factious cases.  
1. When a faction comes to notice for the first time, efforts should be made to nip it in  the  bud.   Conciliatory  methods  may  be  successful  at  times.  If  the  faction persists, there should be no hesitation in setting the relevant law in motion. Police should give clear message to the factionist that the police would mean business in dealing with any disturbance or crime and follow it up with necessary measures. The factious villages shall be covered effectively during day by beat area police officers. Informants should be cultivated and information network be built up. Arrests u/s 151 Cr.PC. should be made where necessary. 
1. Even a minor incident resulting from a faction should not be ignored. Section 160 IPC and sections 106 and 107 of CrPC should be used. In all cases under section 107 of the Code the Magistrate should be requested to take interim bonds from the parties. In some cases, it may be necessary to take action under clauses (e) and (f) of section 110 of CrPC against important faction leaders and rowdies. In cases of factious riotings and affray, the Magistrate should be requested to bind over the parties  under  section  106  of  CrPC.  If  police  officers  furnish  all  background material on the sureties, it will enable the Magistrate to decide whether to accept the surety or not and jail the persons if sureties are not to his satisfaction. 
4. Even after the parties to a faction have been bound over under section 106 or section 107 of CrPC, there should be no relaxation of vigilance in regard to that faction, as instances are not wanting in which even after action has been taken under the security sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure, factious parties have committed overt acts and indulged in sudden outbursts of violence. Every such incident, however small including the attempts should be taken cognizance of. The offenders should not only be charged for the specific offence but also action  taken  for  forfeiture  of  their  bonds.  If,  in  spite  of  all  these  measures, factionists continue to be active, the Superintendent of Police should have no hesitation to come up with proposals for quartering additional Police in the area. 
4. All  incidents arising  out of  a faction  should  be recorded  in  the general  diary forthwith. An exhaustive note about the faction and its leaders and members with their  antecedents,  as  well  as  information  collected  from  time  to  time  by Constables of the beat should be made in Part IV of the concerned Station Crime History by the SHO.   Rowdy sheets should also be opened for those who are persistent factionists. 

**Dispersal of Mobs** 

217\.  The  instructions  for  the  dispersal  of  mobs  and  for  use  of  fire  arms  are  contained                  in  the  Police  Drill  Manual,  besides  legal  provisions  under  section  129  to  132  Cr.P.C.   

District, City Armed Reserves and Civil Police shall constantly practise these instructions. 

An unlawful assembly may be ordered to disperse by a Magistrate or officer-in-charge of a 

Police Station and when so ordered, it is the duty of the members of the unlawful assembly to 

disperse. If they do not, force* may be used to disperse them.  Any Police Officer may without 

warrant arrest the members of an unlawful assembly and thus disperse the assembly. The 

following* points have to be borne in mind. 

1. The  Police  must  secure  the  presence  of  an  Executive  Magistrate  as  far  as                   possible  where  a  breach  of  the  peace  necessitating  the  use   of  force   is 

   anticipated.  The  Executive  Magistrate  on  information  or  requisition  by  police should be present at the spot. When a Magistrate is present at the spot he should be in complete charge of the situation. He has the necessary legal powers to order any Police Officer to assist him in handling the situation. The senior most Police Officer  present  is  bound  to  assist  the  Magistrate  by  mobilizing  the  available Police Force and utilizing them as best as possible. 

2. If the crowd becomes defiant and the use of teargas, lathi charge or both are inexpedient  or  fail  in  their  purpose,  use  of  firearms  may  be  resorted  to.  The Magistrate is responsible for taking a decision as to when an unlawful assembly has to be dispersed by force and also the kind of force to be used. After such a decision  is  taken,  the  officer-in-charge  of  the  Police  is  solely  responsible  for deciding the exact amount of force to be used, the manner of using it and the settling of the details of the operations connected with the use of force, all the time  keeping  in  mind  the  principle  that  no  more  force  and  no  longer  than necessary should be used. 
2. When a Police party is formed for dispersing an unlawful assembly, it should be numbered and split off into two or more sections. Each section should be under the charge of an officer. All commands to the Police are to be given by the Officer in command of the party. The Police are not on any account to open fire except by word of command of their officer, who has to exercise an extreme caution and discretion regarding the extent and the line of fire. 
2. Officers commanding police parties will, ensure that the fullest warning is, if feasible, given to the mob in a clear and distinct manner before any order is given to use tear gas or lathies or fire arms. They will use the most effectual means to explain before hand to them that in the event of the Police party being forced to open fire, the fire will be effective and on the target. Whenever firing is resorted to,  directions  and  warnings  to  the  mobs  should  be  announced  through loudspeakers. Police vehicles should be equipped with loudspeakers and where such arrangements cannot be made hand megaphones should be kept ready for announcement. 
5. Even after being warned, if the mob does not disperse, the order to fire may be given. If the officer in command of the party is of the opinion that it will suffice if orders to only one or two files are given, he may accordingly order specifying the files that are to open fire. If, however, he considers that it will be insufficient, he will give the word of command to one or more sections to open fire. The fire order of each section will be given, by the regular word of command by the officer-in-charge  of  the  party.  Firing  should  be  well  controlled  and  officers ordering firing should always indicate the number of rounds that should be fired at any particular time. 
5. Where the situation warrants firing over the heads of the crowd and where it is considered likely to be effective in dispersing the violent mob, such firing should be resorted to only with blank ammunition. Other policemen should be kept ready with rifles loaded with live ammunition so that if the use of blank ammunition fails, the Police would not be taken by surprise or overwhelmed. Firing with live ammunition should be directed against the most threatening part of the crowd, the aim being kept low. Firing should cease the moment it is no longer necessary. 
5. Files  or sections  ordered to fire  shall  unload  immediately  after firing  without further word of command until the order to cease firing is made finally. Firing should cease the moment the rioters show signs of dispersing and all help should immediately be rendered to tend or convey the wounded to the hospital. 

VIII.  An Armed Force should never be brought so close to a large and dangerous mob 

as to risk its being overwhelmed by numbers or being forced into action resulting in infliction of heavy casualties. Firing should be carried out from a distance sufficient to obviate the risk of being rushed on and to enable strict fire control. 

9. Riot flags and display banners should be taken when District Reserves are called out  in  apprehension  of  disturbances  and  before  firing  or  any  other  means  of dispersal is resorted to. They should be hoisted in front of the mob in a manner that  what  is  written  on  them  is  clearly  visible  and  can  be  read  or  clearly understood by the mob. 
10. The Police used for dispersing mobs should wear the prescribed uniforms and steel helmets.  The teargas section and the armed party protecting the teargas section should wear antigas respirators. 

**Right of Private Defence** 

218\. In the matter of dispersal of unlawful assembly the right of private defence can be exercised to protect the life and property of public or to protect themselves. This right can be excercised by using force as much as is necessary and as long as it is necessary. This right extends even to the causing of death in certain cases as laid down in section 100 IPC as against body and in section 103 IPC as against property.    The police should exercise this right cautiously.  Any amount of exceeding the right may make them liable for penal action as per law.  Therefore, the police officers must make a judicious use of this right, only in dire need to save the life and property, when occasion arises as shown in sections 100 and 103 I PC. 

219\. **Special Police Officers for Law & Order Purposes** 

1. When there is apprehension that there is likelihood of disturbance of peace, riot or formation  of  unlawful  assemblies  or  when  such  unlawful  assemblies  already formed for provoking breach of peace and when it is felt that the existing ordinary police is insufficient to meet the situation, special police officers can be appointed for such time and in such manner as deems necessary for the protection of life and property of the inhabitants. 
1. Every SDPO shall maintain a list of residents suitable with good antecedents for such duty at each place in his Sub-Division in order that he may be able at any moment to give the Magistrate the necessary details to enable him to appoint without delay as many special Police Officers as may be necessary. The lists should be updated every year. Those persons who have been in NCC, NSS, scouts and  guides  and  employees  in  the  government  departments  and  other  young persons of good antecedents would be the proper persons to be included in the list. The ex-servicemen are also useful for the purpose. 
1. A list of all Special Police Officers thus appointed shall be displayed in the local police station. The place of muster, which need not necessarily be a police station, shall be attended at the time by an officer not lower in rank than a Sub-Inspector. He shall check the attendance of Special Police Officers and allot their duties in writing specifying the hours of duty and its nature. 
4. The requirement of discipline for such special police officers should be liberal and ordinarily the physical drill is not necessary.  The form of compliments to seniors will not be a salute but a civilian method of greeting. The periods of duty shall not be long and reliefs shall be frequent. The work of Special Police Officers shall be supervised  and  checked  and  absence  from  duty  noted  by  specially  selected Special  Police  Officers  to  whose  charge  they  are  given.  The  Special  Police Officers  whenever  necessary  shall  be  strengthened  and  supported  by  regular police. They shall remain as separate bodies, and the duty of using any necessary force shall be performed by regular police. Negligence or refusal to serve without sufficient  excuse or  disobedience  to orders  or  directions  makes  him  liable on conviction and fine. 
4. If a motor vehicle belonging to a Special Police Officer or obtained on loan by him or any of his personal property is damaged or lost during its use by such officer on duty, the cost of such damage or the value of such vehicle, as the case may be, in so far as it is not covered by insurance or is not met by the insuring office, will be made good by the government, provided that the claim in respect of such cost or of such value is made promptly and through the concerned police authority.  The  government  will  also  award  reasonable  compensation  for  any injury or the loss of life to the Special Police Officer, if it is directly due to his service as such. 

220\. **Additional Police for Law and Order** 

1. Additional  police  may  be  quartered  under  legal  provisions  for  controlling deteriorating law and order situations. Sanction for such additional Police should be obtained from the government and formal proposals as to how the cost should be recovered should also be submitted to the government. 
1. When  the  District  Magistrate  and  the  Superintendent  of  Police  consider  that additional  police  should  be  stationed  in  any  area  in  the  district,  the  SP  will immediately submit proposals to the Zonal Inspector-General/DIGP, through the District Magistrate furnishing information. The District Magistrate will forward the proposals with his remarks to the Zonal Inspector-General/DIGP. On receipt of the proposals the Zonal Inspector-General/DIGP will, if necessary, visit the area in question in order to satisfy himself that the conduct of the inhabitants of the  area  justifies  the  imposition  of  additional  Police.  If  he  is  satisfied  that additional police are necessary, he will endorse the proposals received from the district authorities and forward to the DGP. 
3. On receipt of the proposals from the Zonal Inspector-General/DIGP, the DGP will move the Government for the imposition of additional police and, if they agree, request them to issue a notification in the Government Gazette. As soon as the notification is published in the Government Gazette, the Superintendent of Police will draft the force of the strength mentioned in the notification to the area, from the district police strength. 
3. Soon  after  the  notification  in  the  Gazette,  the  District  Magistrate  will  submit proposals to the Government through the Zonal IG/DIGP and DGP as to manner of recovery stating clearly the financial condition of the inhabitants of the area from whom the cost is proposed to be recovered and the manner of distribution of cost amongst them.  If it is considered desirable that any of the residents should be exempted from the contribution, the reasons should be clearly stated. 
3. Whenever  it  is  considered  desirable  to extend the period  by which  additional police have been imposed, a report, specifying the reasons for retention of the force  and  the  further  period  for  which  the  force  should  be  retained,  will  be submitted  by  the  SP  to  the  DGP  through  the  District  Magistrate  and  Zonal IG/DIGP at least two months before the term for which it was originally imposed expires. Before submitting the proposals it must be ensured that the dues till the date are collected/recovered. Additional police may not, without the sanction of the  government,  be  retained  beyond  the  term  for  which  they  were  originally imposed. 
3. **Duties performed by additional force :** The duties to be performed by additional 

   police are (a) to patrol the affected area and (b) to restrain the inhabitants of the area from committing excesses (c) any other duties prescribed by the SP. The Station House Officer is responsible for ensuring compliance of the duties. 

**Campus Violence and Student Unrest** 

221\. **Reasons:** The breaches of peace occasioned by students' violence both in and out of the campus require special attention of the police. There are many reasons and occasions when violence breaks out. These may be broadly classified as internal and external. Internal causes relate  to  purely  problems  of  students  relating  to  fees,  mess  facilities,  curriculum, examinations,  copying,  ill  treatment  by  authorities,  scholarships,  group  rivalries,  student elections, ragging, misconduct of staff members or assault by outsiders on a student, teacher etc. Some problems may be genuine, some may not be. The external causes relate to political, social or other causes in which students or groups of them involve themselves either within the campus or outside. Like all other situations, information collection is the most important duty of police and an essential requirement. The SHO by personal contacts with students and teachers should keep himself abreast of the affairs involving the groups in the colleges or Universities in his jurisdiction. The guidelines for dealing with students' violence or incidents are given below: 

1. Keep the Head of the Institution informed of visits to the campus as far as possible. Only in an emergency where a violent incident has occurred or about to take place and  where  it  is  not  possible  to  inform,  the  police  may  rush  to  the  spot  making arrangements  for  information  to  the  Head  of  the  Institution  or  other  responsible person of the Institution. 
1. Do not express opinion as to the right or wrong of the cause or person, but only act according  to  law.  Conduct  parlays  with  rival  groups  to  avoid  imminent  clash  if possible. Take assistance of student leaders or neutral teachers to persuade against violence. 
1. Make prompt arrest if a serious incident like grievous hurt or homicide has taken place. While proceeding to deal with an outbreak of violence, strong police must be taken. All policemen should be doubly briefed on restraint and conduct. Use of force should be avoided as far as possible, unless there is no other way to* stop further violence. While making arrests avoid doing so in the full view of the students, unless 

   it is in the course of dealing with an unlawful assembly. 

4. Assist University/College  authorities  in  ensuring that only genuine and legitimate inmates stay in hostels. Universities and College authorities should be prevailed by higher police officers in this regard. Assist the in situational authorities for keeping order during examinations and other activities. 
4. Collect full and accurate information regarding gangsterism, eve-teasing or assaults on  teachers and  act  as per  relevant  law.  Do  not  act  on  hearsay  or on unverified information.  Take  all  steps  as  in  any  other  case  for  investigation  of  an  offence occurring in the campus or hostels. 
4. Visit the campus during normal times so that it becomes easier to handle situations when they occur. Always remember that the students, being young and emotional are prone to flash actions impulsive and hasty acts. Handling of situations should be done with  proper  understanding  of  the  issues/situation.  Where  group  clashes  are  likely there should be no hesitation to initiate action under section 107 CrPC and to obtain bonds. 

222\. **Ragging** : The menace of ragging in the name of introduction and familiarization of newly entrant fresh students, by senior students of the educational institutions has, of late, taken an ugly turn of serious concern. This practice of ragging is more prevalent in the medical, engineering and business management college/institutes. In a few cases, the victim students have taken the extreme step of committing suicide. To prohibit this bad practice of ragging within or outside any educational institution, the governments have enacted the Laws prohibiting ragging. The 'ragging' means doing an act, which causes or is likely to cause insult or annoyance or fear or apprehension or threat or intimidation or outrage of modesty or injury to a student. The act includes words either spoken or written or signs or sounds or gestures or visible representations. Penalty for ragging is provided under each respective Act. Whenever any student complains of ragging to head or manager of an educational institution, such head or manager should inquire into or cause an inquiry to be made into the complaint forthwith and if the complaint is prima- facie found true, shall suspend the student or students complained against, for such period as may be* deemed necessary. The decision of the head or* manager of the educational institution in this regard shall be final. 

1. **Duties of Police :** The police officers have to play an important and active role in curbing this menace of ragging. Therefore, all Ss.P./Cs.P. should instruct their subordinates before the commencement of the academic session to contact Heads 

   of the educational institutions and enlighten them on the provisions of the law.   Head  of  educational  institution  should  also  be  advised  to  give  wide  publicity about the provisions prohibitively ragging. 

2. University and College hostels should be visited especially in the nights and in the beginning of the academic session along with the wardens and university/college staff. If necessary complaint box may be kept in the hostels. Efforts to collect intelligence or deploy men in plain clothes at the beginning of academic year besides keeping vigilance over senior students and also request the management to  take  preventive  action  besides  involving  the  non-government  organisations should be taken by the police to stop ragging. Suo-moto action should be initiated where the institutions or the targeted victims do not come forward to lodge a complaint for fear of reprisal.

Chapter 203 

**Handling Communal Situations**

**Introduction** 

223\. Communal disturbance means an agitation or interruption of tranquility involving two antagonistic religious communities. It may also be defined as an agitation arising out of a conflict between two or more religious communities. The nature of a conflict may vary from minor disturbances to big riot situations. Such disturbances always pose a serious threat to law and order. Communal disturbances are always attended with considerable loss of human life  and  destruction  of  property;  they  disrupt  communal  harmony  and  aggravate  tension between different communicates. They undermine public faith in the forces of law and order. If they occur on a large scale, they even threaten the stability of the country. Prevention or minimization of communal disturbances is, therefore, vital to the maintenance of law and order;  smooth  functioning  of  a  secular  democracy  and  the  stability  and  integrity  of  the country. 

**Causes of Communalism** 

224\. Communal disturbances and the causes underlying them are manifold. The main causes appear to be historical, activities of communal parties, opportunistic and parochial policies of political  parties,  enemy  acts,  mal-treatment  of  minority  communities,  and  prevailing prejudices  between  members  of  the  different  communities.  Conflict  of  interests  and competition between two communities for sharing of economic and educational opportunities may,  sometimes,  assume  the  form  of  communal  disturbances.  In  the  ultimate  analysis, prejudices, wrong attitudes and an atmosphere of mutual distrust and fear are responsible for communal  disharmony.  Absence  of  adequate  mutual  participation  in  social  and  cultural activities and a lack of devotion to common secular and non-religious values, consequent living in almost closed societies, largely contribute to the continued existence of prevailing prejudices and disharmony. 

225\. **Role of the Police** 

1. Maintenance of public order to a large extent depends on the response of police 

203

and happens to be a basic responsibility of the police. Police Acts and the criminal procedure code require the police to maintain public order and to interpose and to proceed to the spot to investigate actual or suspected commission of offences. Under section 127 and 128 of CrPC, the officer-in-charge of a Police Station and other  senior  police  officers  are  entitled  to  command  dispersal  of  unlawful assemblies or even to use force for that purpose. The duties and powers of the police in India are both statutory and obligatory. The police are, therefore, duty bound to maintain law and order during communal disturbances. 

2. The  police  must  remain  absolutely  impartial  in  handling  of  communal disturbances. The senior officers have a special responsibility in properly briefing their subordinates in this regard. The police officers must realize that communal disturbances are one of the worst threats to law and order and, therefore, they should be especially remain alert to this problem. Competent and selected officers should be posted to sensitive areas having a history of communal disturbances. 
2. Although,  sudden  eruptions  cannot  be  completely  ruled  out,  all  communal disturbances, by and large, develop over a period of time. If right steps are taken in the beginning, it may be possible for the police to prevent communal tensions from  developing  into  disturbances  and  violence.  The  police  should,  therefore, attach special importance to the preventive aspect of their duties in this regard. 

226\. **Preventive Action** 

1) **Collecting  of  Intelligence  :**  The  first  step  in  preventing  communal  tension  from developing into violence is the collection of adequate and advance intelligence. This should be done by Special Branch at the State Headquarters and also at the District Hqrs. Police should get in touch with the leaders of both communities and find out the causes of tension. The past history of the place, the writings in the press, particularly local press, and, the vernacular press, the likelihood of repercussions of disturbances in neighbouring districts or neighbouring States should be given special consideration for prevention and handling of communal incidents. 
1) **Rumors :** Generally, rumours play a very important role in the aggravation of communal tension. Although, rumours are a common phenomenon in normal life but in such situation, 

205

these assume nastier and more purposive character. Rumours relating to communal, tensions generally go through the following three stages: 

1) They begin with talks of alleged insults and discrimination. 
1) The common stories of imminent violence, of the arming by the other community, of the need to protect house and loved ones from attack. 
1) Finally, the crisis rumours develop and spread for example, inflammatory acts, like sex assault, beating or other crimes etc. 
3) **Watch on Community Leaders :** During communal tension, the communal groups and their leaders, exhibit a progressive tendency to operate more boldly and more openly. They step up their propaganda; a campaign against other communities as they presume that there will be a greater degree of social acceptance of their views during such times. Their activities must be kept under close watch.  
3) **Preventive Arrests and Other Action :** After collecting advance intelligence, it should be carefully assessed and appreciated by the senior officers and preventive action should be planned. If there is time, action under section 107, 117 of the criminal procedure code can be taken against ring leaders and other anti-social elements. Arrests under section 151 of the code of criminal procedure of ring leaders and mischief mongers of both the communities can also be made. Remand can also be taken for police or judicial custody of persons arrested under  S.  151  Cr.P.C.  Arrests  of  ring  leaders  and  anti-social  elements,  who  may  fish  in troubled waters, can also be made under the Preventive Detention Act for detaining persons for longer period. However, sufficient material should be collected in advance regarding their activities and speeches, etc., so that action under Preventive Detention Act can be taken and sustained against them. 
3) **Prohibit  Entry  and  Promulgation  of  Prohibition  Orders  :**  It  may  also  become necessary to either restrict the entry of certain undesirable persons into areas of tension or to remove them from such areas in order to prevent their spreading communal propaganda and mischief. Suitable prohibitory orders under section 144 Cr. P.C. may be promulgated and enforced strictly. Issue of licences under Police Act requiring the processions to be taken along certain routes and imposing other suitable conditions should be ensured so that clash with the opposite group or party may be avoided. 

   227\. **Administrative Measures** 

1. Apart   from   the   legal   measures certain administrative steps should also be   taken. Joint Peace Committee consisting of respective leaders of the communities   may be constituted for taking their help and that of other progressive political leaders for controlling the tension   and   preventing   the tension situations from developing   into violent incidents.   
1. Patrolling   should   be   organissd in the mixed   localities.  Meetings of the   minority   community may be called   to assure   them   that   the   authorities will take   all   legal action   to   protect   them.   The   police   should   also make   it   known publicly   and   privately   to   all   that   in   case   of trouble,   they will   take   quick,    firm   and   strong   action.  A close   watch   should be kept on the circulation of   nasty   rumours.   The   best   antidote to rumours   is   that   as soon as rumour   is   found    circulating,  they  should  be  quickly  investigated  and  fact    should    be publicized adequately   and   quickly.   Also persons   found   circulating   such rumour should   be stopped by   police   officers   and   asked   to give   verification and   proof regarding   the correctness   of the   rumour. 

228\. **Post Preventive Measures** 

1. If   preventive   measures   fail   and   actual trouble   breaks out the   police   will have   to   take   action   to deal   with the   same.   The   communal   mobs   are   always  under   an intense   excitement  and  they   are  swayed  by   feelings   of hatred and they  do  not   hesitate  to take  recourse to  violence.   Such mobs are generally not   amenable to   reasoning   and   persuasion.   The   police   should, therefore,   use   determined,    swift   and   effective   force   to deal such   mobs   right   in   the   beginning.    
1. If the mob   gets   an   impression that the   police   are   either   weak   or   undecided   in   their   attitude, it may embolden them to become highly violent and destructive.  While in the initial   stages,   mob   violence   may   be   directed   against specific   targets   like members   of the   opposite group and their   property,   as   it   gets   into   

   high   gear,   it   may   become more generalized   and   may be directed   to   general public and their property. Determined   and   strong   police   action at the   initial   encounter with the   mob, therefore, is of crucial   importance. 

**Police Action Parameters** 

229\.  In  order  to  make  police  action  effective  depending  upon  situation  to  situation,  the following points should be kept in mind : 

1. Attempt should be made to prevent the formation of crowds and to break them as soon  as  they  are  formed.  For  this  purpose,  patrolling  and  posting  of  pickets  at strategic points will be necessary. The crowds can be dispersed under Section 127 of the Cr.P.C. 
1. Arrest  of ring  leaders may be  made,  if that  is  possible, without  provoking  much trouble. 
1. If a crowd is already formed, it should be cordoned off so that its size does not increase by the joining of other people. 
1. As  soon  as  the  mob  starts  indulging  in  violence  or  it  is  clear  to  the  police  that violence will be resorted to, immediate action should be taken to disperse the same. The police can use force for this purpose under section 128 of the Code of Criminal Procedure  for  dispersal  of  unlawful  assemblies.  In  such  a  case,  orders  of  the Magistrate, if present at the scene, should be obtained. Force can also be used by the police under the Right of Private Defence (Sections 96 to 106 of the I.P.C.). For use of force in the exercise of right of private defence, the orders of the Magistrate are not required. 
1. In case of serious rioting, orders under S. 144 Cr.P.C. and the popularly called curfew orders, may have to be imposed and strictly enforced. While major incidents may be controlled by the promulgation of curfew, sporadic incidents of individual stabbing or killing  may  continue  for  sometime,  particularly  in  crowded  areas.  Therefore,  the police must organize foot and cycle patrols in such areas to ensure that there are no such  incidents.  Care  must  be  exercised  in  the  withdrawal  of  curfew  orders.  This should  be  withdrawn  by  stages.  Sometime  withdrawal  of  curfew  orders  may aggravate the situation. After a mob has been dispersed, the police should pursue it and ensure that all persons return home so that the mob does not re-form. Police vigilance and patrolling should continue to prevent any eventuality. 
1. When communal disturbance break out over a wide area in a District or a City, the 

   overall  command  of  operations  must  remain  in  the  hands  of  the  District Superintendent of Police. Sometimes, the disturbed area may be divided into zones, where other officers may be deputed, but the overall control must remain with the District Superintendent of Police as he is in the best know of things. Sometimes, confusion may be created by the deputing of other senor officers in the areas, with the result that an overall plan of action and direction of operations is not possible. 

7. The areas of tension should be isolated by effective patrolling and posting of strong pickets. 

viii.  Investigation  teams  of  competent  officers  may  be  constituted  to  register  and 

investigate cases arising out of communal incidents. 

9. A separate officer may be deputed to maintain a chronological record of events. 
9. The injured should be given first aid and the dead persons should be removed to the Mortuary. 
9. Suitable liaison should be maintained with the press to enlist their cooperation in correct reporting and mobilization of public opinion against communal tension. 
9. Patrolling pickets in sensitive areas and general police vigilance should continue till complete normalicy is restored. 

xiii.  Policemen have to be on duty at various places for many days. Satisfactory feeding 

and shelter arrangements should be made for them. 

230\. **Broad Based and Comprehensive Administrative Measures** 

1. A high powered Standing Council presided over by the Home Minister consisting of representatives  of  major  political  parties,  officials  of  the  Home  Ministry,  police officers  and  eminent  sociologists  may  be  constituted  to  review  the  communal situation  and  advise  the  government  on  a  regular  basis  on  measures  to  promote communal harmony and to minimize communal disturbances. Similar Councils may be constituted at field level also. 
1. Citizens committees consisting of respectable members of the majority and minority communities as well as district officials should be constituted at the district and the police station level. These committees can meet periodically to review communal situation. They may also mobilize popular support resolving differences in times of communal tension. 
1. Setting up of Research Institute consisting of eminent Sociologists, Psychologists, Economists,  Lawyers  and  Police  Officers,  to  go  into  the  cause  of  communal disharmony and to suggest remedial measures. The institute should be an independent body and may collaborate with Universities and other centers of thought in its work. 
4. Formulation  and  effective  implementation  of  appropriate  policies,  if  considered necessary, to give effect to the secular provisions of the Indian Constitution. These provisions are contained in articles 14, 15, 16, 19, 25, 26, 28, 29 and 30. 
4. The Government should evolve a definite policy in regard to ordering of judicial inquiries into the use of force by the police to control communal disturbances or other incidents. Too frequent appointment of such judicial inquiries may create fear and hesitation in the minds of police officers to use force swiftly, effectively and in a determined  manner.  Normally  an  administrative  inquiry  should  be  held,  and  if  it makes out a prime facie case that there has been either unjustified or excessive use of force by the police, a judicial inquiry may be ordered. 
4. A policy should also be formulated in regard to the withdrawal of cases by the State. Normally, cases against persons who have indulged in communal riots should not be withdrawn, but if it is thought necessary to do so in exceptional circumstances, a definite policy in this respect should also be evolved. 

231\. **Political Approach and Attitude** 

- Major political parties should evolve a code of conduct and agree not to take advantage of communal feelings for gaining political advantage. 
- They should propagate secular ideals and value and mobilize public support for the same. 

**Legislative Measures** 

232\. A bill introduced in the Parliament  to amend Sections 153-A and 505 of I.P.C. to enlarge their scope to enhance the provision of punishment and to make them cognizable has been approved. Amendment of Section 8 of the Representation of the people Act 1951 to provide for the disqualification from the membership of Parliament or State Legislature of persons convicted of offences under Section   153-A or   505   of the   I.P.C. and a law to prevent the   publication   of   alarming, incorrect   or   provocative news   or   views   likely   to disturb   communal harmony   also have deterrent effect.  These   are   welcome measures.   In   addition   to  these  measures,   the State  may pass   enactments   on  the   lines   of  the   M.P,   public   Security Act   1959   to   arm  the   law   and   order   authorities  with additional   powers  in   regard   to  the   entry   of  certain persons   into   certain   areas,   regulation   of  the   publication and   circulation   of   provocative   and   alarming news  or views,   control   of  camps,   parades   and  drills,   prohibition or  restriction   of  the  use   of   pathways and   roads,   and constitution   of  special   courts. 

233\. **New Police Strategy** 

 ¾The   police organization   should be considerably strengthened   and   improved   by   

providing greater and better quality of manpower, better equipment, greater   mobility   and   better   communications. 

 ¾The   Intelligence   Branch   of the   police   should be strengthened   at   all   levels.  ¾Training   of   policemen   should   be   more   intensive in methods of crowd control   

and    handling  violence  such  course  should    include    lessons    in    crowd   psychology   and   social psychology.   Specialized   riot   control   squads   with special training   should   be set   up   in every   city and district. 

 ¾A   suitable   research   organization   should   be   established in   those   State   

police   Headquarters  where  the   incidence of  communal   disturbances   is  high,   to   objectively  evaluate  the   handling   of  communal  disturbances  by  the   police.   This research organisation should   make   a critical and objective analysis   of   each   situation   handled   by the   police,   and   make   its   findings   available   to all   officers   in the   field   as well   as police   forces in   other   States. 

 ¾Police   plans   in   respect   of communal   pickets   or   areas having   a   potential   of 

communal disturbances   should be prepared and   kept   ready.  Such plans should   be   based on a careful appreciation   of   the nature and magnitude of the   problems   likely  to  be  faced.  Estimates  of  requirements  and    availability  of  manpower,   transport, control   room   and   communication   facilities,   and   equipment, etc.,   should   be   made   and   included   in   the plan. 

**Educational Measures** 

234\. The syllabi of all educational institutions should be reviewed   and,   if   necessary,   revised to ensure that the secular   values   and   requirements of national   integration unity are  adequately  emphasised.   Such  a  review,  of  course  should    also    see  that    no objectionable   material which may promote communal disharmony is contained   therein. 

235\. **Cultural  and  Social Impacts** 

1. There   should   be   greater   inter-community participation   in cultural and social   activities. For   this   purpose, recreational   facilities,   sports,   and youth clubs, etc may   be   organised   in which members   of both the   majority and minority communities may be encouraged to participate. 
1. Communal   disturbances   are outer   symptoms   of the deeper   malady   affecting   the   body   politic.   These   are   a   product   of political,   social,   economic,   cultural, administrative   and   other factors   in   the   society.   Only   an   integrated,   concerted  and sustained   action   on  all those   fronts  can  strike  at  the  conditions that   give  rise  to communal  disharmony   and  disturbances.   The police   need to   be   associated   with and   play   an active role   in the combined   social   action   against the   communal menace.   The   main role   of the   police, however, is limited   to dealing   with the   outer manifestation   of the communal menace   involving   potential   or actual   violence   and   actual   or   potential commission   of offences. The   main   objective   of the   police   should   be   to prevent   communal tensions breaking   into   violence   and   in the   event   of its   emergence to control   and contain   it   within   minimum   limits.  This   is a heavy,   difficult   and   delicate responsibility   on the   police which has to be discharged   with determination,   efficiency   and impartiality.   In this task,   they   should solicit   the cooperation and support of leaders of public   opinion,   the press,   administrative agencies and major social   institutions. 

**Legal Provisions** 

236\.  The  legislature  has  provided  strict  laws  on  preventive  as  well  as  punitive  side  for preventing and punishing the commission of crime relating to communal disturbances. 

1. **Preventive Provisions :** 
1) **Preventive action under the Cr.P.C. :** 

**(i) Security for good behaviour u/s 108 Cr.P.C. :** Any person who either orally or in writing or in any other manner, intentionally disseminates or attempts or abets dissemination of any matter the publication of which is punishable under section  124-A,  153-A,  153-B  or  295-A  IPC  or  any  matter  pertaining  to intimidation of a Judge or any person who makes a publication of any of matter punishable u/s 292 IPC, may be bound down by a Magistrate for one year and may required to furnish security for good behaviour. Hence all such persons like communal  elements  who  disseminate  such  matter  may  be  bound  down  in advance. Police stations and the D.S.B. should have complete record of speeches and uttering of such persons which provide very good evidence under this section. 

2) **Preventive  Police  action  regarding  processions  and  Assemblies  u/s  144 Cr.P.C.  :**   Freedom  of  conscience  and  religious  liberty  are  guaranteed  to  all persons including foreigners under article 25 of the Constitution of India and also a right to form associations or unions is guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (a), of the Constitution. But these rights are not absolute and the State is empowered to impose  reasonable  restrictions  in  the  interest  of  public  order  safety,  morality, health and public user of thorough fares etc. Hence laws regarding regulation of religious and other precessions and Assemblies have been inacted u/s 144 Cr.P.C, and  the  Police  Act,  u/s  144  Cr.P.C.,  when  a  police  officer  considers  that  an assembly  or  precession  is  likely  to  commit  a  communal  riot  or  other  public disturbance,  procession  or  assembly  can  be  prohibited  under  the  orders  of  an appropriate Magistrate. This can be done only when maintenance of public order becomes  impossibility  without  restricting  the  religious  assemblies  and processions. This ban cannot remain in force for more than two months hence the police  should  be  able  to  control  the  communal  disturbance  within  this  time otherwise  a  fresh  order  shall  have  to  be  taken  again.  Curfew  orders  banning assembly of persons or appearance at a public place at a certain time" can also be issued  by  the  Magistrate  but  a  blanket  order  "Shoot  at  Sight"  for  violation  a curfew order is clearly illegal as violation of an order under 144 Cr.P.C. is a minor offence u/s 188 IPC punishable with 6 months imprisonment only. "Shoot at  Sight"  orders  are  justified  either  on  grounds  of  private  defence  of  life  or property u/s 100 103 IPC or to cause dispersal of an unlawful assembly which is likely  to  cause  disturbance  of  public  peace  u/s  129  Cr.P.C.  Hence,  "Shoot  at Sight" orders should not be passed generally but only when serious threat to life and property is apprehended to the degree of rights given u/s 100 & 103 IPC' 129 Cr.P.C. 
2) **Dispersal of unlawful assemblies u/s 129 Cr.P.C -** In any communal riot, any 

   Executive Magistrate, Officer In charge in a Police Station in his absence any. Police Officer not below the rank of Sub Inspector may command an unlawful assembly or any assembly of 5 or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the  public  peace,  to  disperse  and  if  such  assembly  does  not  obey,  it  can  be dispersed  by  force  including  firing  also.  But  for  dispersal  a  minimum  force, required should be used. Help can also be taken of Armed Forces u/s 130 Cr.P.C. under the orders of Executive Magistrate. Disobedience of this order for dispersal if not abided by any member of assembly is punishable **u/s** 188 IPC. 

4) **Preventive action including arrest u/s 149, 150 & 151Cr.P.C.** - U/s 149 of the Cr.P.C. every Police Officer is duty bound to the best of his ability to prevent commission of Cognizable offence. U/s 150 Cr.P.C. every Police Officer is duty boundto inform the S.H.O. or his immediate superior of any design of any person to commit a cognizable offence. 
4) **Preventive  measures  under  respective  Police  Acts  -**  Under  such  Act preventive detention order can be issued against persons who either by violent speeches or by organizing militant processions, demonstrations and activities of like nature try to disturb public order when communal tension is already going on. This  action  can  be  taken  against  the  local  bad  characters  who  can  flare  up communal tensions. However, it is necessary that a disturbance of "Public Order" is not confused with "Law and Order". A person can be detained for trying to disturb "Public Order" but not for disturbing "Law & Order". An individual who might have committed a murder but if that murder does not disturb public order as a  stray  case,  he  can  not  be  detained.  Although  the  Courts  do  not  relish  the violation of personal liberty of individuals guaranteed under article 21 & 22 of the constitution, yet, in a number of decisions the courts have shown encouragement to preventive detentions for prevention of communal riots. Hence **u/s** 151 Cr.P.C. a Police Officer knowing a design to commit any cognizable offence may arrest," without warrant, any person so designing, if it appear to such police officer the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented. As such preventive arrest u/s 151 Cr.P.C. can be done if a Police Officer has information about the design to commit a communal disturbance if he thinks that the offence can not be prevented except by way of arrest. It is worth while to mention that under this provision arrest can not be made merely on the apprehension of breach of peace. It is required that the Officer arresting must know that the persons to be arrested is designing to commit a cognizable offence. However, it is well settled that apart from malafide, the correctness of the information or the opinion of the Police Officer, cannot be questioned in a Court of Law. 

**Forfeiture of Blasphemous Publications u/s 95 Cr.P.C.**  

237\. Under this section State Government is entitled to forfeit blasphemous publications which have a tendency to promote communal disharmony or offend the religious sentiments of others and the offending material false within the mischief of Section 153-A or 153-B or 295-A  IPC.  It  is  essential  to  mention  in  the  forfeiture  order  that  religious-feelings  of  a particular  class  have  been  outraged  or  it  promotes  feelings  of  hatred  between  particular classes of citizens. In such publications, truth of the matter published is no defence yet the publication to be forfeited must be considered as a whole and isolated passages torn from the context should never be picked up to pass such order of forfeiture. It is decided that basic religious books like Koran, Ramayana, Gita and Bible can not be forfeited being sacred books. An object held sacred by a class of persons, with in the meaning of Section 295 Penal Code, no action should be taken. 

**Special Provisions u/s 153 -B**

**Offences Relating to Religion Under Chapter  15 of  IPC** 

239\. Under this chapter sections 295 to 298 of the IPC deal with different offence relating to religion. 

1. **Section  295**  - Under this section injuring or defiling place of worship with intend to  insult the  religion of  any class  is punishable with  2  year imprisonment. 
1. **Section 295-A** -This section provide punishment of   3 years of imprisonment to any person, who, by deliberate  and malicious  acts out  rages  religious feelings  of  any class by insulting  its religion or religious beliefs.

is also  a serious offence u/s  145.  When force or violence  is used by the unlawful assembly becomes  a riot define u/s  146 and who ever is guilty of  rioting, is punishable u/s  147  and if the rioting, is with arms  is becomes  a serious offence u/s  148 punishable with 3 years of  imprisonment, u/s  149 every member of the unlawful assembly has been held liable for every offence committed in prosecution of that common object.

Chapter 218 

**Terrorism, Bombs & Explosives**

**Introduction** 

240\. Terrorist groups the world over have been increasingly relying on use of explosive devices to spread terror, coerce the people into submission and pressurize the governments to accept  their  unreasonable  political  demands.  The  increasing  dependence  of  terrorists  on explosive devices is not only because of their damage potential but also due to various other factors which include: 

1. Abundance of sources of explosives, 
1. Ease with which explosive devices can be manufactured, transported, handled and fitted with variety of unsuspecting objects multiplying their potential manifold, 
1. Difficulties faced by the security agencies in timely detection and diffusion of the bombs, 
1. It  is  much  safer  for  the  terrorists  to  use  explosive  devices  and  cause  severe damage/loss to the target without themselves suffering any loss since they need not be present physically within the effective zone, 
1. The psychological  impact created  by the explosion on the  morale of the security forces and the public in general. 

240\.1 In India, most of the terrorist/militant/extremist groups are resorting to increasing use of explosive devices. Over the years the casualties among the security force personnel and even  civilians  have  been  increasing  because  of  explosions  carried  out  by  the terrorist/extremist groups. All terrorist and extremist groups operating in the country have been making extensive use of explosive devices to target VIPs and security personnel and create panic. The police have a special and specific role, duty and responsibility to deal with terrorism issues and handle the incidents of bombs and explosives in this context. 

**Bomb Threats** 

241\. The primary purpose of any bomb threat is to disrupt the normal activities of society, government or business. It may be directed toward a person, family, or a group for scare threat, terror, intimidation or revenge. A bomb threat may be a fake call or can be an actual 

218

warning. A warning may be to cause only property damage and not human injuries or death. Warnings may be coded, which is often the practice of some known terrorist groups. Some warnings may contain more details and may as a matter of procedure validate the threat. This uncertainty or validity of any threat is required to be taken seriously, acted upon and not ignored.  

**Bomb Threat Searches** 

242\. Search is the method to check the validity of the threat or otherwise. The most efficient and expeditious system for the occupants of the building is the search. The occupants are familiar with the building and know what does or does not belong inside. This is termed as "defensive search". 

**Communication of the Threat** 

243\.  Bombs  threats  can  be  communicated  in  a  number  of  ways.  These  are  generally communicated in one of three ways. The most common made is telephone. However, such threats may also be written or communicated verbally. 

1) **Telephonic Communication :** Some of the characteristics of the telephone communication are :  anonymity, remoteness and poor possibility of trace, voice  recognition,  and  recording  which  provide  scope  for  follow-up investigation. 
1) **Written Communication :** The characteristic of written communication is that it provides documentation/ evidence, provides a sample for handwriting analysis  and  provides  trace  and  origin  possibilities  for  follow-up investigation. 
1) **Verbal Communication :** Characteristic of verbal communication is that it provides  person-to-person  communication  where  conversation  can  be overheard  or  monitored  and  personal  recognition  or  identification  and/or voice identification is possible for follow-up investigation. 

**Procedures for receiving a bomb threat by telephone** 

219

244\. A telephonic bomb threat should be received in the following manner : 

1. Remain calm. 
1. Have a covert signaling system, such as a coded buzzer signal to alert a second telephone receptionist to listen in on the call and/or record the call if equipped to do so. 
1. Keep the caller on the line as long as possible. 
1. Ask the caller to repeat the message. 
1. Make a written record of every word the caller says that you can recall. 
1. If the caller docs not indicate the location of the bomb or the time it will detonate, ask for the information. 
1. Inform the caller that the building is occupied and the detonation of a bomb could result in death or injury to many innocent people, then note his or her reaction. 
1. Pay  particular  attention  to  peculiar  background  noises,  such  as  motors  running, background music, or any other noise. 
1. Pay close attention to the caller's voice: i.e. is the caller male or female? is the voice calm or excited? does the caller have an accent? does the caller have a speech impediment?  
1. Immediately after the caller hangs up, report the threat to the senior officers. 
1. Complete the bomb threat checklist. 
1. Remain available to speak with law enforcement personnel. 
1. Forward  notification  of  the  bomb  threat  to  the  local  police  department  and  other appropriate agencies according to procedural guidelines. 
1. Preserve any recording of the threat as evidence for law enforcement. 

**Types of Searches** 

245\. Searches to be conducted as a follow up of bomb threat are following: 

1. **Counter  Terrorist  Search**  include  systematic  procedures  to  locate  any  terrorist resource,  including  personnel,  hides,  munitions,  weapons,  documents,  equipment, bombs, and booby traps 
1. **Defensive Search Operations** are those operations undertaken primarily to protect potential targets 
1. **Evidential Search** is the legitimate search of any person, building, conveyance, or area  conducted in order to  locate any person or item sought in  the pursuance of criminal evidence 
1. **High Risk Search** - Counter terrorist search is classified high risk when a bomb or booby trap (explosive or otherwise) is present, or when there is special reason to 

   believe that a bomb or booby trap is present 

5. **Low Risk Search** - Counter terrorist search is classified as low risk when a bomb or booby trap (explosive or otherwise) is not present or when there is no special reason to believe that a bomb booby trap is present 
5. **Offensive  Search  Operations**  are  those  operations  undertaken  primarily  to  gain evidence    for prosecution,    to  deprive terrorists  of their resources,  and to  gain intelligence 
1. **Personal Search** 

246\.  Suspected  persons  must  be  searched,  because  terrorists  transport  small  arms  and ammunition and other incriminating items concealed on their clothing or body. Items found are directly  attributable,  increasing the  chances  of a  conviction and  making  this type of search is particularly important. Great care must be taken when carrying out a search of a person,  as  there  is  the  inherent  risk  of  alleged  brutality,  assault,  or  unethical  acts. Furthermore, since most people searched are innocent, the police must search in a manner that demonstrates their professionalism and courtesy. These factors make it imperative that searches of people are only conducted in circumstances which can be legally carried out and which involve procedures that minimize the risk of accusations against the police. Searches must only be conducted in accordance with the law. Persons who conduct searches must be aware of the appropriate laws and approved practices.  

**Constraints of Personal Search** 

247\. Principle constraints with regard to the search of persons are following: 

- The search must be conducted by a person of the same sex, if possible. If it is not possible then minimize and confine the search to areas where weapons are likely to be concealed, explain to the arrestee the purpose of search and have a witness to observe. Use protective gloves during the search. 
- Generally, the police cannot require a person to remove clothing in public other than an outer coat, jacket, or gloves. If the subject does not consent to the search and the search is out of the public eye, there may be authority to require the removal of outer clothing. 
- Intimate body searches involving the internal examination of body orifices other than the mouth may only be carried out by licensed medical personnel after authority has been obtained. 
- A search should only be conducted to the detail necessary to discover what is being sought. 
- The level of detail within a search is dictated by what is being sought, legal justification, permissible extent of the removal of clothing and necessary intimacy of the search 

**Categories of Personal Search** 

248\. There are four categories for searching persons. These are :  

1. Quick body search or frisk (in the public eye),  
1. Detailed body search (out of the public eye),  
1. Strip search (usually at a place of custody) and  
1. intimate body search (by a medical practitioner). 
1. **Quick Body Search or Frisk** 

249\. The quick body search generally called frisking should be carried out when dealing with a large number of people and a detailed body search is not warranted. As a preliminary to a detailed body search, when the immediate requirement is to detect anything which could be used to harm the searcher, the person being searched, or anyone else. As a preliminary to a detailed body search when the immediate requirement is to secure any evidential material which could be discarded or destroyed before the detailed search. If possible, such searchers should work in pairs, with one person doing the physical searching and the other observing the searcher, the subject and the surrounding area. Following precautions should be taken: 

- The searcher should not stand directly in front or behind the subject to avoid being kicked, kneed, or head butted. 
- The searcher should not be distracted or intimidated and should avoid eye contact with the subject 
- The  observer  should  watch  for  non-verbal  communications,  such  as  increased nervousness or tension. 
- When weapons arc being used, the searcher should avoid crossing the line of fire of a covering officer. 
- Ideally the subject should stand with legs slightly apart arid arms extended sideways. Avoid spread-eagling the subject against a wall. Later it may be necessary to swab the subjects  hands  for  explosive  traces,  and  no  opportunity  should  be  given  for  any remains or residue to be rubbed off. 
- The search should be conducted quickly in a systematic manner from head to foot, down one side and up the other, covering all parts of the body, front and back, or by dividing the body into quadrants. 
- Attention  should  be  paid  to  pockets  and  waist  bands  where  weapons  may  be concealed. Care must also be taken to search quickly all external body depressions, such as the small of the back, armpits, crotch areas, chest, and closed hands. 
- The searcher should never pal the subject, but use a stroking squeezing movement and thus feel for foreign objects through clothing. 
- When searching limbs, both hands are used with thumbs and index fingers touching where practical. 
- Any baggage or removed clothing attributable to the subject must also be searched. Such items should be treated with respect. 
- The use of equipment, such as hand and archway metal detectors or explosive and baggage x-ray machines, can be of assistance, especially at times when processing large numbers of people at access control points. 
2. **Detailed Body Search** 

250\. A detailed body search is normally carried out when there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the subject is in possession of illegal items. This search would normally be conducted out of public view; however, the search must be conducted at or nearby the place where the person is first detained. A detailed body search should be conducted using the same procedure as the quick body search but with the addition of the following points: 

- Establish the identity of the subject and the ownership of any baggage and other articles. 
- Ideally the search should be conducted out of the public eye. The details of the search depend upon the amount of suspicion and the time available. 
- Invite the subject to empty all pocket and remove all items and paper being carried. 
- If it is necessary to remove clothing, the subject may do so voluntarily (this fact should be recorded), or you may require the removal of certain items in or out of the public eye. Typically, in the public eye, only the outer coat, jacket, gloves and hat should be removed. Out of the public eye, there may be grounds to remove other outer clothing, also. 
- When  conducting  the  search,  pay  attention  to  every  detail,  particularly  clothing 

  seams, waist bands, belts, collars, lapels, padding, cuffs, and rolled up shirts, pants, etc. Socks and shoes provide easily missed hiding places. Areas such as the groin, small of the hack, chest, and thick hair arc also commonly missed areas, especially on females. Medical dressings are always suspected, and medical personnel should be called to examine dressings and plaster cast if thought necessary. Information from clothing, such as name tags, manufacture's labels, and laundry marks can be valuable. 

- Unless there is some future interview advantage in doing so, no emotion should be shown upon finding articles, and significant articles should not be set aside from others unless they are weapons or evidence. All items should be saved out of reach of the subject. 
3. **Strip Search** 
1) A strip search is a search involving the removal of more than outer clothing. A strip search may take place if it is necessary to remove an article which a person would not be allowed to keep, and the officer reasonably considers that the person might have concealed such an article. Generally, strip searches are not routinely carried out where there is no reason to consider that articles have been concealed. The procedure for the strip search is similar in principle to the searches outlined above. The following additional points apply: 
- A strip search shall be conducted as quickly as possible. 
- The search should be conducted by a police officer of the same sex as the person being searched. 
- The  area  where  the  person  is  searched  cannot  be  seen  by anyone who does not need to be present or by a member of the opposite  sex  (except  an  appropriate  adult  requested  by  the person being searched). 
- Except in cases of .urgency, where there is risk of serious harm to the person detained or to others, whenever a strip search involves exposure of intimate parts of the body, there must be at  least  two  people  present  other  than  the  person  being searched. 
- The  search  shall  be  conducted  with  proper  regard  to  the sensitivity  and  vulnerability  of  the  person.  Embarrassment 

  should be minimized. 

- Where  necessary  to  assist  the  search,  the  person  may  be required to hold their arms in the air or stand with their legs apart so that a visual examination may be made of the genital and anal areas, provided no physical contact is made with an intimate area. 
- If articles are found during the search, the person shall be asked to hand them over. 
2) The clothing should be carefully examined when it is removed.  However, if there is the slightest possibility that the clothing may have forensic value (explosive traces,  fiber  evidence,  etc.),  it  should  be  immediately  preserved  and  sent  for examination. Care must be taken to avoid any possible contamination of items of forensic evidential value. 
4. **Intimate Body Search** 

251\. Body orifices other than the mouth may be searched only with proper authority if: 

1) An article or potential weapon which could cause physical injury to the detained person, the officer, or others has been concealed; or 
1) The person has concealed a Class A drug which he/she intended to supply to another person; and 
1) In either case, an intimate search is the only practical means of removing the article or drug. The procedure for an intimate body search is similar to the searches outlined above. The following additional points apply: 
- The reason why an intimate search is considered necessary shall be explained to the person before the search takes place. 
- The search may only be carried out by licensed or authorized medical personnel. 
- Search under (a) above may only take place at a hospital, surgery, other medical premises, or police station. 
- Search  under  (b)  may  take  place  only  at  a  hospital,  surgery,  or  other  medical premises. 
2. **Building Search**  

252\. The nature and focus of the building search should depend on the evaluation of the threat. If the building has to be subjected to extensive search it should first be evacuated. Although several things are to be considered in evacuation, the officer responding to call should contact the concerned officer-in-charge of the place and advice him that the location should be evacuated, complete evacuation may not be necessary. 

**Evacuation Precautions** 

253\. Most bombs are located on the outside of a building, near the entrance or on the first floor or at the place of actual function. Hence while evacuating; the occupant would be passing by the best possible location of a bomb. The occupants, therefore, may be placed in greater  jeopardy  while  they  are  leaving  than  if  they  stayed  where  they  were.  Hence evacuation  of  the  building  or  function  site  may  not  be  always  time  considered  the  best procedure. Decision by the search officer should be taken after assessing the situation. 

**Evacuation Instructions** 

254\. Following guidelines may be followed when a decision has been taken to evacuate a building or place where a function is to be held :- 

1) Ask the occupants to walk out of the building in a quiet manner.  Don't run. 
1) People should go to safe areas and wait for instructions. 
1) Do not use elevators/lifts/conveyors. 
1) Follow instructions from guides. 
1) Open all windows/doors. 
1) Carry all personal belongings. 
1) Do not leave safe area until told. 
1) Help ladies, old people and children. 
1) Cut off gas and electric supply before leaving. 
1) Do not obstruct passage of security/bomb search personnel. 
1) Do not spread rumours in assembly or safe area to cause panic. 

254\.1 Standard building searches will vary according to the type and dimension of the search. Teams may be increased or diminished in size by varying the numbers of search pairs, as appropriate  to  the  task,  but  technique  should  remain  the  same.  Where  there  are  real suspicions that a premise is or has been used by terrorists, consideration must be given to the priorities of entering and searching such a building. First consideration should be toward danger, whether from occupants or whatever they may have left. Second, every effort must be made to retain all possible forensic evidence. Third, systematic search should ensure that nothing of relevance remains hidden. 

**Building Search Procedure** 

255\. Standard building search procedures can be considered in tour phases :- 

1. Planning 
1. Entry 
1. Search 
1. Exit 
1. **Planning** 

256\. The following points are particularly relevant to standard building search procedure and should be considered for inclusion in operation orders and briefings: 

 Address and precise location of the building;***  

 Building  description,  including  identification,  structural  details,  out  buildings  and 

garages, and plans if available     

 Details of previous searches at the same or nearby addresses  

 Surrounding area environment and local mood 

 Details of occupants and owners - numbers, gender, age, previous convictions, violent 

tendencies, health, employment  

 People likely to be in the building at the time of the search  

 Occupants' vehicles - type, color, location 

 Dogs or dangerous animals present which may require a specialist 

 Authority to search (warrant) 

 Probable point and method of entry  

 Timings  -  briefings,  cordon  placement,  first  and  last  light,  entry  and  expected 

completion (A small dwelling house may take at least four : hours to search.) 

 Search manpower - ensure sufficient personnel to deal with the anticipated occupants 

and carry out the search. 

 Cordon manpower 

 Communication - channels (restricted and scrambled preferred), call signs, and code 

words 

 Other agencies - explosive search dogs, photographer, female searchers, entry team, 

investigating officers, evidence collection officer, and support personnel 

 Equipment requirements - search kits, ladders, optical equipment, Polaroid camera, 

pocket tape recorder, and refreshments 

 Transport - quantity, type (covert), security 

 Documentation - search records, inventory lists, copy of warrant, etc. 

 Clothing - appropriate to type and nature of search and weather, including soft shoes, 

masks, disposable gloves and coveralls to avoid contamination of evidence 

2. **Entry** 

257\. Following guidelines should be followed when entering a building to conduct a search: 

- It may be necessary for a cordon to be positioned prior to the start of the search to prevent the escape of suspects from the search area, witness any attempts to dispose of evidence, and ensure the security of the search team. 
- If the search is linked to the investigation of terrorism, police officers should only be referred to by number and not by name especially within the hearing of suspects. 
- It is frequently necessary to enter the building rapidly in order to catch persons in physical possession or to prevent them from disposing of evidence. For example, suspects may flush evidence down the toilet in some cases, it may be necessary to monitor all waste water and sewage systems from buildings prior to entry by the search teams. 
- After briefing and before entering the building or search area, the search pairs are allocated their initial areas of responsibility, 
- Enter  the  building  with  a  minimum  of  disturbance.  Maintain  strict  control  of occupants and police personnel during the early stages of any search to counteract tension and confusion. Tension and confusion can be minimized by good planning, thorough briefing, and regular training. 
- Each search pair moves quickly through its area, locating any occupants. 
- All keys are handed to and retained by the scribe until the conclusion of the search. 
- If there arc clear indications that a building, room, or area requires a detailed forensic examination (for example, it is the scene of a violent crime or illegal manufacture), 

  the forensic examination must be completed prior to the search.  

**Preparation for building search** 

258\. When preparing to conduct the search, following guidelines should be observed: 

- Before the search commences, the occupants should accompany the team leader and recorder throughout the premises to conduct a check of damage existing prior to the search. The details are noted on the Search Report. 
- It may be appropriate for a photograph or video to be taken of the damage. 
- When the check for damage is complete, the occupant is invited to sign the Search Report, agreeing to what has been recorded. 
- Simultaneously the check is being conducted, a sketch plan of the building and rooms should be drawn by the recorder, ensuring that each room and area are allocated a unique identifier, such as kitchen, bathroom, bedroom 1, bedroom 2, etc. 
- Gas, water and electricity meters should be read, particularly if the search is likely to take  a  number  of  days.  Such  information  can  then  be  available  to  counter  any exorbitant claim made for the use of these facilities while police are in occupation. 
- Computers should not be touched, as any action can cause evidence in them to be destroyed. If found switched on, then leave it switched on. If found switched off then leave it switched off. Deny access to them by the occupants and employ specialists to 

  retrieve information. 

- Search pairs are allocated rooms to search systematically. It is advisable to search the kitchen and toilet early in the search, to enable use by both occupants and police. 
- During  the  planning  and  briefing  for  the  search,  decide  whether  to  allow  the occupants  or  person  responsible  for  the  property  found  in  a  specific  area,  to  be present in or near the room as it is searched so that finds may be witnessed as they are made. Such action may interfere with the effectiveness of the search and slow it down; however, their presence and reaction at the time of the find may strengthen evidence given later. 
- In counter terrorist operations, where the search may well be part of a number of searches,  the  investigating  team  must  decide  and  brief  on  what  the  search  team 

  requires. 

3. **Systematic Search** 

259\. A systematic search is the heart of the operation. Searching of the whole building and identified areas must be done systematically so as to ensure that nothing is missed. Search pairs are tasked progressively by the team leader, and the recorder completes the search record detailing who did what, where,  and when. Detailed documentation is  essential to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and that nothing is missed. The following procedure is recommended for searching a room and using any search equipment that may be required : 

 Stand at the door, look, and listen. 

 Identify to the Team Lender all visually obvious and relevant items so that they can 

be recovered and documented by the Evidence Collection Officer. 

 Complete visual/no touch search of the room for anything obvious. As a pair, search 

all furniture, using a "no damage" marking system, such as removable stickers or chalk, to record progress. Move all furniture into one half of the room. Consider the run of the floor boards so that complete lengths can be lifted if necessary. As a pair, closely search the floor, walls, ceilings, and fixtures in the cleared half of the room.   Examination of the   floor may determine the necessity of lifting the floorboard and covering.  If  so,  use  correct  methods  and  equipment  to  minimize  damage.  Walls should be checked from floor to ceiling, working around the room from a chosen point, perhaps from the doorway. Do not forget the door and frame. The ceiling and walls should be checked for height and width against neighboring rooms to ensure there are no false cavities. 

1) **Room Search** 

260\. When searching rooms, check the following :- 

 Doors (Take off the hinges. Is the door hollow?) 

 Furniture and interior fittings 

 Walls and air vents 

 Windows (especially sash type) and outside ledges 

 Fireplaces and chimneys 

 Ceilings (compare ceilings from different rooms) 

 Floor coverings and floor (particularly loose floorboards) 

 Lights and fixtures when searching bathrooms,  check the following : 

 ¾Drain pipes (extra) 

 ¾Panel surrounding the bath tub or shower 

 ¾Shower curtain rods 

 ¾Behind and under the bath if possible 

 ¾Toilet and water tank 

 ¾Hot water system 

 ¾Mirrors and towel racks 

 ¾Examination panels 

 ¾Recently tiled, disturbed, or mismatched areas. 

2) **Search of Stairways** 

261\. When searching stairways, check the following :- 

* Staircase frame 
* Panels 
* Step and riser treads 
* Boxed and hollow woodwork 
3) **Search of Attics** 

262\. When searching attics, check the following : 

 9Roof void and skylights 

 9Between eaves and rooting 

 9Water tanks and pipe work, including gutters  9Rafters and any insulation, such as felt or beads 

4) **Search of Kitchen** 

263\. When searching kitchens, check the following :- 

![ref1]  Refrigerators, stoves, and other appliances (Switch off power supply before moving) ![ref2]![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]![ref6]![ref7]

![ref8]  Food containers, pots, etc. (Tip the contents out into Polyurethane bags, and then ![ref1]![ref2]![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]![ref9]![ref7]

replace them in the original containers.) 

5) **Other Searching Areas :** 
- All tubular systems 
- False letter boxes 
- Crib and children's toys 
- Air inlet systems 
- Sewers and drainage systems 
- Outside areas, including vehicles, garages, and outbuildings 
- Electricity boxes 
- Televisions and other electrical devices 
- External fittings, such as gutters, pipes, and window boxes 
- Outbuildways, garages, vehicles 

264\. After a room has been searched, it must be left in its original state. Any damage caused must be reported to the Team Leader and recorded on the Search Record. Photograph and video may be appropriate. 

**General Precautions** 

265\. Searchers must always use their eyes, think three-dimensionally, and consider any voids within closed spaces. Remember that hidden items may be more than arms length away. Look as well as feel. Persons secreting articles may "mask" them by using rubbish, dirty washing,  used  sanitary  napkins,  or  diapers  to  discourage  the  searcher  from  detailed examination. Minimize damage by the correct choice and use of tools and search equipment. Work closely as a pair and monitor each others actions. For example, search one piece of furniture together. Talk to each other to maintain motivation and system. 

4. **Area Search** 

266\. Open areas are often used as the sites for hiding places, as they have the advantage that they can be watched from nearby houses without being attributable to individuals. Although normally associated with a rural environment, open spaces occur in an urban setting in the form of parks and gardens or vacant ground. Therefore, the areas to be searched may vary from the side of hill to a back garden. 

1) **Planning** 

267\. Area searches are especially dependent upon good planning for success. The following points  are  particularly  relevant  to  the  planning  and  conduct  of  an  area  search.  Where appropriate, these points should be re-evaluated as the search progresses. 

 ¾Indicate the center of the search area by a lot number or grid reference, with an 

address if possible. 

 ¾Obtain the identity of the owner or tenant of the land. 

 ¾Information gained from aerial photographs, even if only library material is valuable. 

An analysis should identify the most likely hide locations. 

 ¾Air reconnaissance may be useful, but care must be taken to avoid giving advanced 

warning to the terrorist. Obtain details of suspected terrorists and sympathizers in the area. 

 ¾Search  dogs  can  cover  large  areas  more  quickly  than  men.  Prioritize  the  use  of 

available dogs. 

 ¾Divide the total area into sub-areas. The searching of sub-areas by individual search 

teams requires care. Inclusive and exclusive boundaries must be clearly defined and should be marked by obvious features, such as hedges and ditches. Each team area should be searched in one day. 

 ¾Identify the location of the main incident control point. 

2) **Hide Locations** 

268\. An appreciation of the needs of the terrorists helps in identifying likely hide locations. These vary with the situation and the type of bide being sought, but common points include: 

- Case and speed of access 
- Proximity to a road or track 
- Base of locating the bide 

268\.1 The location of the hide includes the general area, which must be easily identifiable, such as a small hedgerow or building. The precise location of the hide may be marked in some fashion. This applies particularly to temporary hides. The markers may be artificial, such as a painted fence post, but are usually some natural landmark that is identifiable at night. Examples of terrorist markers include: 

- A distinctive tree in the comer of a field 
- A lone tree in the center of a hedgerow 
- A gap in a hedge 
- A telegraph pole in a hedge 
- Any distinct natural object or set of objects 
- Case of access into the hide itself 
- Concealment and camouflage 

268\.2 The terrorist does not want to be seen when actually using the hide. Therefore, it is likely to be in dead ground, although the general area may be observed by a sympathizer. The surroundings  of  the  hide  must  provide  natural  camouflage  and  concealment.  It  should provide proximity to terrorist's route to or from targets. A terrorist's local knowledge may obviate the need for markers. Searchers should be suspicious of anything out of place, such as worn patches of grass, broken twigs, footprints, etc. Use aerial photography to identify recent digging or the disturbance of the normal pattern of plant growth. 

268\.3  The  search  of  areas  is  normally  conducted  on  the  principle  that  the  most  likely locations for hides are searched first, including team individual control power, boundary, primary search points and other vital points. The team commander must always ensure that the whole area is searched. Searchers must remember to look up as well as down. Even if a find is made, they must carry on searching, as there may be other hides in the vicinity. 

5. **Route Search** 

269\. Route search is a defensive search operation carried out on both urban and rural routes that are to be used by a person subject to protective measures. Routes include roads, tracks, railways, and waterways. They provide obvious locations for the terrorists to stage ambushes. The likely methods and locations of a terrorist attack must be given special consideration when planning and throughout the execution of the route search operations. 

**Ambush Weapons** 

270\. From a search viewpoint, the main threat is that of an improvised explosive device used as an ambush weapon against the target. Improvised explosive devices used as an ambush weapon, which can be anti personnel or claymore type, blast or fragmentation bombs, culvert bombs  or  direct  the  weapons.  All  these  devices  require  some  device  of  initiation,  radio control, projectile control etc. 

**Terrorist Considerations** 

271\. A terrorist will attack his target where it is particularly advantageous. The target is always at greater risk when he has to slow or stop due to traffic lights, road junctions, sharp bends, narrow roads, and other impediments. These positions are known as vulnerable points. Examples of vulnerable points are: Culverts, bridges, high banked stretches of route, routes dominated by high ground (possible firing points), junctions, isolated buildings and walls near the route, and parked vehicles etc. 

The choice of a vulnerable point is influenced by  

**Route Search Methods** 

272\. The following consideration should be taken by police when determining the best search method:

 Type of route-urban, rural, or channeled 

 Predictability of target 

 Movements known 

 Route used more than once 

 Publicity 

 ¾Threat assessment 

 ¾Level of protection 

272\.1 The three search methods are: 

 Full route search 

 Vulnerable point search 

 Search and seal followed by visual search. 

6. **Vehicle Search**  

273\. Vehicles are searched for three reasons: 

 To find terrorist resources while they are in transit  To deter the movement of terrorist resources 

 To detect the movement of criminal resources 

273\.1 Vehicle search covers a very broad field, from bicycles to ships and aircraft. This concentrates on the most common- the car - but the principles involved embrace all forms of transport, although the more complex, such as aircraft, may require special planning and assistance. 

273\.2 Terrorists and criminals may try to avoid being searched and may be working in liaison with others. Signs of such behaviour may include signaling to the following vehicle, such as flashing brake lights or using radio and movement of the pedestrians who may have left vehicles just before the check point.   

**Initial Impressions** 

274\. The initial impressions created by a vehicle and its occupants may give a good guide to their integrity. The search may have come as a surprise and their apprehension may be at its height. It is important that the search procedure should not given them time to compose themselves. When forming an initial impression, follow the guidelines below: 

- Look at the faces of the driver and passengers. Are they relaxed and normal, or tense and nervous? 
- Beware  of  the  over  police,  apparently  "pro  police"  persons.  Nobody  likes  being delayed. 
- Look for anything suspicious or out of place like  

I.Driver wearing gloves (he or she may be trying not to leave fingerprints)  II.Vehicles with "out of place" occupants 

III.Vehicles  with  open  windows  on  cold  days  or  strong  smells  of  scent  or 

excessive  smoking  (Are  they  trying  to  disperse  or  cover  the  smell  of explosives?) 

IV.Vehicle which appears overloaded (down on rear axle). It could be a large 

vehicle bomb. 

 Look at the door and window catches. Broken catches may indicate forced entry. 

 Tell the driver to switch off the engine while you are talking to him. If the ignition has 

been short circuited in order to steal the car, he or she will be unable to comply. 

 Look  at  the  ignition  key.  Most  drivers  have  their  keys  on  a  ring  or  medallion.  Be 

suspicious of a single key in the ignition switch.  

 Ask the driver to estimate the contents of the trunk and describe where the spare wheel is 

stowed. Watch to see if he or she can open the trunk with the correct key. 

 Request the driver to open the hood. He or she should know where the release is situated.   If a radio is fitted, turn it on to make sure it is not tuned into a police frequency. 

 Ask the driver to operate the accessories, such as the windshield wiper, lights, etc.  

 Cross check the age of the vehicle, as shown on documents, with marking on the vehicle.  Always verify doubtful answers with a check of registration and warrants, but remember 

that it is not infallible. The terrorist may steal or hijack a car from a person who cannot or 

dare not report the theft, or it may be so recently stolen that it has not yet been reported.  Always be aware that if the occupants are terrorists, they may be armed and traveling in 

escort with others in another vehicle.  

274\.1 In all vehicle searches, a suspicious and inquisitive mind is required, in particular to check all welding and bodywork repairs, suspect unnaturally clean or dirty areas, follow pipes and ducts from one compartment to the next, to remain aware of false compartments to check the internal and external dimensions.  

274\.2 Searchers must be courteous, efficient, through, and quick. They must not refrain from searching the interior of vehicles due to the presence of children and babies, pets, old people, young ladies, or apparently stick or drunk persons. If necessary, special assistance must be called. 

**Conducting Vehicle Searches** 

275\. Procedure for vehicle search is following:- 

1. Ask the drivers and passengers to dismount from the vehicle with their possessions.  
1. Search all occupants with their possessions. 
1. Allow a search (drugs or explosives detections) dog, if available, to search the vehicle. The search pair then starts with the interior search. 
1. Search the vehicle. The owner or driver may watch the whole operation. Any change in demeanor should be noted. 

275\.1 For all vehicle searches, the vehicle should be divided into the five areas listed below for the search: 

  Interior of the vehicle 

  Exterior of the vehicle 

  Trunk or cargo area 

  Engine compartment 

  Underside of the vehicle 

**Searching the Interior of the Vehicle** 

276\. Check the following parts of the interior of the vehicle: 

1) **Roof lining** 

-Grain access by removing door sealing strips or trim. -Check sun visors. 

-Check front, rear, and center window. 

-Check door pillars. 

2) **Door panels** 

-Lower  the  window  first. Can  you search  without removing the  trim?  Avoid  damage  to spring clips and other parts. 

-Check that the windows and doors open easily and completely. 

-Check the rear side panel (two door vehicles) 

-Remove and check through the trunk. 

3) **Back seat** 

-Check the cushion - some spring in some bolted in 

- Check the back rest 
4) **Front seats** 

-Look for easy stow under seat. 

-Check inside padding and under seat. 

-Are the front seats bolted to a hollow cross member? 

5) **Dashboard area** 

-Be careful of wiring and other components. 

-Check behind dashboard panels. 

-Check ventilation and heater hoses. 

-Check radio and speakers. 

-Check behind and above the glove box. 

-Check the contents of the ashtray and beneath the ashtray -Check the center tunnel console. 

6) **Front foot wells** 

Remove panels and check access to wing space and door seals. 

7) **Floor** 
- Remove carpets and mats. 
- Check for signs of false floor, such as welding or mastic. 
- Check drain holes. 
8) **Recreational vehicles (RVs) are ideal for smuggling, since they are double-skinned vehicles.** 

-Check for access to space between the skins. 

-Do the timber panels look unusually thick? 

-Check domestic fittings. 

-Does the refrigerators work, and is the insulation intact. 

-Does the water tank contain water? 

-Is the toilet system functioning correctly? 

**Searching the Exterior of the Vehicle** 

277\. When searching the outside, search the top and sides of the vehicle, starting at the rear, with one searcher on either side or finish at the front of the vehicle. Areas of particular attention are listed below: 

 Check headlights, sidelights, and rear lights. 

 Check behind bumpers. 

 Check wheel trims and hubs. Check tire pressures. Bleed a small amount of air and 

smell the air. 

 Examine under wheel wells and bolt-on mud flaps. 

 Check for signs of welding, new under seat (soft), and tampering with bolts on mud 

flaps. 

 Does the shape of inner and outer fenders agree? 

 Take an oblique look at the bodywork and roof for signs of adaption. 

 Check the front and rear panel and spoilers. 

 Check for different shades of paint. 

1) **Searching the Trunk or Cargo Area** 

278\. This is done by the clean pair. Before they start the search, they should stand back and look at the contents. Do they match the driver's story? Is there any glue, mastic under seal, or pop rivets? 

278\.1 The search pair should search all contents, including the spare wheel, before removal of items from the trunk or load carrying area. Once searched, these items should be placed to one side. The search pair then searches the compartment as a pair, from the rear of the rear seats to the number plate, top to bottom. Once the search is complete, the searchers should replace everything. Areas of particular attention are listed below: 

 Check the spare wheel. 

 Is there any new welding, mastic, or new paint? 

 Are there any stuck down carpets? 

 Check the space in the wings. 

 Check the tailgate 

 Check the fuel tank. Is it spare or false? Does the tank match the vehicle, age, etc? A 

mechanic will be required to drain the tank. 

2) **Searching the Engine Compartment** 

279\. This is a difficult area to search. A good idea is to use searchers who have a good knowledge of engines. Areas to check include: 

 Under battery tray 

 Windshield washer bottle 

 Heater and ventilation hoses and vents 

 Heater and ventilation motor 

 Air filter 

 Hood double skin and soundproofing 

 Volkswagen Van-heat shield. Checking anything more is a mechanic's job. 

3) **Searching the Underside** 

280\. To search the outside skin of a vehicle, the pair should start shoulder to shoulder at the front or rear license plate. One works the offside and the other the nearside. 

Areas of particular attention are: 

 Behind license plates 

 Light clusters 

 Bumpers  

 Mirrors 

 Drain holes and seals 

 Welding/new undersea! 

 Exhaust system - false section  Oil pan 

 Wheel wells 

4) **Additional procedures for a Counter Terrorist Search** 

281\.  Specialist  equipment  may  be  available  for  use  on  search  of  vehicles,  including explosive vapour detectors and mass/density anomaly detectors. Use of this equipment must  always  accord  with  manufacturer's  instructions  by  trained  operators.  When searching searchers must be careful not to damage the vehicle. Common sense must be used.  Although small, bicycles and motorcycles should not be ignored. They are a quiet and fast way of carrying small quantities of terrorist resources and may even contain the bomb itself. Bicycles have been used for major terrorist strikes by LTTE in Sri Lanka including for killing President Premdasa. Motorcycles and scooters have been used by Sikh terrorists on a number of occasions in India.**  

281\.1 Points of check include:  Light and bell 

 Pump under the seat 

 Tubular frame 

 Fuel tank 

 Underneath the machine 

**Search of commercial vehicles** 

282\. The vehicle may not be owned by the driver. If the vehicle is part of a large fleet, it is likely to be inspected and maintained by persons other than the driver to make any modifications to the vehicle to form a hide without being discovered. However, if the driver is the owner or if the vehicle is part of a small company where all the employees are in the conspiracy, it could have been extensively and skillfully modified to form hiding places. 

1) **Driver as Suspect** 

283\. If the driver alone is under suspicion, he or she has to collect and deliver the illicit 

goods without the vehicle owner's knowledge. Therefore, collection and delivery have to be completed quickly, and concealment is likely to be in a readily accessible place. 

2) **Goods** 

284\. The goods may have no connection with the owner or driver of the vehicle. They may  only  have  the  information  contained  on  the  consignment  documentation.  The searching of a vehicle's load at other than its destination can present any problems, such as  customs,  sealing,  handling  (especially  when  hazardous  cargoes  are  involved),  and deterioration of cargo (refrigerated loads). The use of cross loading techniques may be required. 

3) **Passengers** 

285\. The following points should be kept in mind when searching passenger carriers: 

 Passengers  are  unlikely  to  be  associated;  therefore,  they  must  all  be  individually 

questioned and searched. 

 The majority of passengers are probably innocent and their patience is likely to be 

severely strained by a lengthy search. 

 Movement of passengers must be strictly controlled so that they can be associated 

with  their  baggage  and  seats.  The  whole  of  the  vehicle  being  searched  must  be dominated  to  prevent  unauthorized  movement  of  passengers  and  incriminating material being dumped. A Polaroid photograph, taken as soon as possible after the vehicle is stopped, may help in relating passengers to positions and luggage. 

**Point of Interest** 

286\. Points of interest on a commercial vehicle are described below: 

1) **Fifth Wheel** 

287\. Most trailers are constructed in such a way that there is a hollow compartment above the articulated joint where the trailer is connected to the tractor unit. This joint is commonly known as the fifth wheel. Access may sometimes be gained underneath the trailer and can be checked with a light and mirror. Fiber-optic instruments have been able to get into most of the fifth wheel spaces. They are simple to use and more versatile than a light and mirror. In some cases, the only way into the compartment is to remove the floorboards inside the trailer, which are usually held down by two screws at each end. The spare wheel can be used as a 

place of concealment and is unusually mounted under the trailer. Positions may vary. 

2) **Fuel Tanks and Side Lockers** 

288\. Some trailers are fitted with belly tanks for extended range. There is usually a space between the top of the tank and the floor of the trailer. Items can be attached to the top of the tank. Also check the tank for recent welds or bolted panels. Similarly, there is often a space between the back of the side lockers and the chassis number on which they are mounted. 

3) **Chassis cross-numbers** 

289\. Most trailers are constructed with two "U" section girders running the whole length. A large hide can be constructed by placing boards on the reverse ledges, bridging the gap between the girders.  In addition, battery boxes, crash bar bumpers, open trailers, cab linings, air filters, false floors or roofs should also be searchers carefully. 

289\.1  Such  searches  tend  to  be  complex  operations  with  a  number  of  features  which differentiate  them  from  other  search  operations.  Therefore,  special  planning  and  control procedures have been developed for them. Some of these procedures may also be applied to other  large  defensive  search  operations.  The  Site  Coordinator  (or  a  number  of  site coordinators if there are different sites to be searched) will be designated as responsible for the search operations. 

7. **Venue Search** 

290\. A venue search is a defensive search operation mounted to assist in providing a safe environment for an event or visit to take place. It forms part of the overall security operation, which is controlled by the Security Coordinator. Such searches tend to be complex operations with a number of features which differentiate them from other search operations. Therefore, special  planning  and  control  procedures  have  been  developed  for  them.  Some  of  these procedures  may  also  be  applied  to  other  large  defensive  search  operations.  The  Site Coordinator (or a number of site coordinators if there are different sites to be searched) will be designated as responsible for the search operation. 

1) **Search Teams** 

291\. Many of the issues involved in the planning phase will not involve searchers; however, 

it is likely that team leaders will be involved in initial site survey and will hopefully be given the opportunity for a familiarization tour or walk through before the search operation. A venue search operation may cover the following: 

 The venue 

 Routes to and from the venue 

 Vehicle control and search points 

 Adjacent buildings 

 Surrounding areas 

 Contingency plans (safe house/alternative venues and routes/evacuation areas) 

 A number of issues may effect the operation, including time, manpower, costs, and 

commercial interest. Political acceptability may even be a consideration. 

2) **Planning** 

292\. The leads times for planning can be very short, especially for events given little or no prior  publicity.  For  public  events  involving  multi-agency  activity,  a  minimum  planning period of eight weeks is not unusual extending up to a year for major planned national or international events. 

3) **Sectorization** 

293\. Once the task is defined, it must be matched to the time and resources available. To assist  in  this  part  of  the  planning  and  the  subsequent  organization  and  control  of  the operations, it is usual to divide the overall location to be searched into a number of sectors, which conform to natural boundaries in the location, such as the floors of a building or possibly a wing of the building. 

293\.1 The sectors are normally designated alphabetically by a single letter starting at the lowest level. The sectors are then sub-divided into sub-sectors; typically a room each sub- sectors  becomes  an  individual  search  task.  The  sub-sectors  are  designated  numerically starting  at  the  same  end  of  each  floor/sector  level;  thus  each  sub-sector  has  a  unique reference number, e.g. F/12. The sector and sub-sector boundaries are marked on the map of building plan. The sector and sub-sector marking code must be logical so that it can be followed in outline without reference to map or plan. 

4) **Building Vulnerability** 

294\. Search teams of all types should be matched to task which best suit their expertise and equipment, with the most proficient being employed in the most vulnerable areas. The venue can  be  divided  into  colored  zones  -  red,  amber,  green  -  these  being  used  as  a  flexible planning aid. Search teams will not normally be told whether the area they are searching is red,  amber  or  green.  This  is  to  prevent  complacency;  however,  as  you  become  more experienced, it will not be difficult for you to appreciate the color of the area you are in. 

**Conduct of search Operations** 

295\. The search operation can be divided into three parts: 

1. Pre-searches 
1. Main phase 
1. Isolation and maintenance of sterility 
1. **Pre-searches** 

296\.  Pre-searches  are  conducted  before  the  main  search  normally  to  save  time  and resources  during  the  main  search.  If  appropriate,  the  following  pre-searches  may  be conducted: 

 Pre-search and seal 

 Explosive vapour pre-search 

**Pre-search and seal** 

297\. Some areas may be able to be searched well before the vent and then sealed to indicate that access is prohibited and to detect illegal access. This type of search is particularly useful for searching areas such as plants rooms and services ducts, which require very detailed work by a few searchers over a long period. Other suitable areas may include storerooms, vending machines,  fire  extinguishers,  street  furniture,  underground  area,  and  roof  voids.  The effectiveness of the pre search and seal is totally dependant upon the integrity of the sealing. It requires the provision and control of suitable seals. Seals should be uniquely identifiable, tamper evident, and unobtrusive. Many types are available. The selection of the seal and its emplacement  must  ensure  that  it  is  effective,  allows  for  easy  checking,  and  discourages vandalism. Once in place, seals must be regularly checked as part of the overall security plan. If seals are found to be broken without a valid reason, the area must be searched again. 

**Explosive Vapour Pre-search** 

298\. An explosive vapour pre-search may be conducted a day or so before the main search with equipment or dogs that detect explosive vapour. The purpose of this search is to obtain a vapour profile of the venue in order to: 

 Locate and eliminate any spurious vapour readings. 

 Identify any vapour problem areas, which can be investigated as a matter of priority 

during the main search phase. 

 Conduct all mechanical vapour sampling prior to the use of search dogs, as   dogs and 

their handlers are often contaminated with explosive vapour, which can cause false readings with detection equipment. 

 Reduce the effects of long warm up times and equipment failures during the main 

search phase. 

298\.1 The use of explosive vapour pre-search must be balanced against he likelihood of a device  being  planted  between  it  and  the  main  search.  The  alternative  is  to  conduct  the explosive vapour search as the first element of the main search. 

2. **Main Phase** 

299\. The bulk of searching is carried out during this phase, which should be conducted in as short  a  time  as  possible  before  the  start  of  the  event  to  reduce  the  chances  of  terrorist resources being introduced after the search, and to reduce the cordon commitment and other costs. Two types of searches conducted during this phase are the Main Search and the Re- task Search. 

1) **Main search** 

300\. The main search involves the searching of the venue sub-sector by sub-sector by search teams using the procedures previously described. The efficiency with which the main search is conducted is dependant upon: 

2) **The command, control, and administrative systems** 

301\. These systems must be established before the main body of search teams arrives on site. These systems determine the early searching and securing of predictable evacuation areas. They also  determine search  cell location  and  rooms intended  for  equipment storage  and resting prior to the deployment of the main body of search manpower. Any areas that are searched in advance must be secured either by way of police cordoning or by sealing. 

3) **Access Control** 

302\. The object of access control is to ensure that no terrorist resources are introduced into the venue after it has been searched and to allow the searchers to work without distractions. Therefore,  once  the  search  of  an  area  starts,  it  must  be  cordoned  and all personnel  and material entering it must be accredited and searched. Ideally the whole venue should be cordoned  and  evacuated  before  the  search  starts  and  no  one  admitted,  except  search personnel, until the search is complete. In practice, it is normally only practical to exclude people from actual areas being searched and the cordon expands as the search progresses. This is known as "ballooning" a search. Separate security personnel (police officers) should be employed on cordons. Searchers cannot effectively both search and cordon. 

4) **Re tasking** 

303\.  If  a  search  team  is  unable  to  complete  a  specific  search  task  due  to  access  being unattainable, equipment malfunctioning, etc., then it is normally more efficient to use the re- task procedure rather than have the team wait. 

303\.1 The search record referring to the incomplete sub-sector is marked as requiring a re- task search, with a brief explanation of the reasons, and the search team moves on their next task. 

303\.2 The search cell staff, on checking the search record, notes the incomplete sub-sector, records it on the search bags, and re-tasks a team to search it when the difficulties have been overcome. If possible, the original team should be re-tasked to complete the search. 

3. **Isolation and maintenance of Sterility** 

304\. The location must be isolated and areas searched kept sterile from the time the main search starts until the end of the vent. This entails: 

 Establishing of a cordon and access control points where personnel and vehicles that 

have a legitimate reason for entering are searched. 

 If necessary, conducting maintenance searches (detailed below) within the area that 

has been searched to confirm that it remains sterile. 

 Retaining sufficient search personnel on site to deal with any contingencies during the 

vent, such as response to a threat call or change of event plan. 

**Maintenance Searches** 

305\. There  may be  a  need to  carry  out further searches  after  the  main  search has  been completed to ensure that the area remains clear. These are known as maintenance searches and  are  particularly  relevant  where  confidence  in  the  access  control  system  is  not  high. Maintenance searchers are not normally required. As an example, maintenance searches may be carried out on a daily basis or before a session is reconvened after a break. There must be close  liaison  between  those  who  carried  out  the  initial  search  and  those  doing  the maintenance search for local knowledge and to ensure that an object discounted during initial search  does  not  cause  alarm  during  the  later  search.  If  possible,  such  items  should  be removed when first discovered. 

**Exit** 

306\. The exit procedure at the end of the search is equally as important as the entry. The exit procedure is outlined below and includes important principles: 

 ¾Once everywhere has been searched and the occupants have been regrouped, 

it is worthwhile for the team leader to mentally review what has occurred. He should ensure that all procedural and documented activity up to that point  have  been  properly  carried  out,  and  exhibits  have  been  properly bagged, documented, and labeled. 

 ¾The occupant accompanies the Team Leader and recorder for a final damage 

Search Report and signed by both the occupant and the team leader. 

 ¾As  the  final  damage  check  is  being  conducted,  the  search  pairs  should 

ensure all search equipment has been accounted for No rubbish or defective or broken equipment (such as batteries) shoul remain on the premises once the search has been completed. 

 ¾The search team and attached officers leave the premises, and any cordon is 

withdrawn. 

**Bomb Squad** 

307\. A bomb squad has the following responsibilities: 

 Render safe and/or remove improvised explosive devices and incendiary chemicals.  Conduct legal and safe transportation, storage, and disposal of explosive materials.  Conduct post-blast bomb scene investigation. 

 Conduct inventory and maintenance of bomb squad equipment. 

 Respond to bomb threats. 

 Provide dignitary protection. 

 Provide training. 

1) **Personnel Selection** 

    Selection committee - A selection committee should be made up of personnel with 

bomb squad experience. 

 Qualifications - Personnel being considered for admission into a bomb squad should 

be tested through one of the personality tests. Candidates should score high in team work traits with low supervision requirement. 

 Physical  qualifications  -  Personnel  being  considered  should  be  in  above  average 

physical condition, with no limitation in physical dexterity. Technicians must be able to perform strenuous physical activity. Testing should be performed for initial and periodic performance evaluation. 

2) **Personnel Training** 

    Initial  training  -  Candidates  being  considered  should  be  given  initial  on  the  job 

training to evaluate their ability to perform tasks assigned. 

 Formal training - After the candidate has successfully passed the initial job training, 

formal training should be conducted. 

 In-Service - Skills learned during the formal training need to be continually applied 

through in service training at regular intervals. 

 Training  records  -  Up-to-date  training  records  must  be  maintained  on  all  bomb 

technicians. 

**Operation Standards**  

308\. Duties of Bomb Squad Officer on arrival 

1. Coordinate with command and assess the situation 
1. Determine the incident category (life threatening or non-life threatening). 
3. Evaluate the need for evacuation. 
3. Verify and request support (fire, medical, canine, etc.) 
3. Gather all witnesses and conduct interviews. 
3. Search for secondary devices or hazards 
3. Establish a bomb squad control point. 
3. Briefs other team members. 
3. Assign duties to other members of the squad. 
3. Get all equipment set up and tested. 

**Situation Assessment** 

309\. Following consideration should be kept in mind  What is the maximum possible amount of explosives?  What is the probable effect (fire, gas leak, damage)?  Is evacuation adequate? 

 What assistance is needed? 

 What category is the incident and can it be reduced?  Where is the best approach route? 

310\. **Incident Categories** 

1) **Life threatening situation** 

 Consider possibilities of reducing the situation to a non-life threatening situation without 

working on the device. 

 Consider the time factors. 

 Due to the extreme nature of a life threatening situation, the bomb technician is authorized 

full latitude in determining the following: 

 9Type of render safe procedures attempted 

 9Type of equipment to be used 

 9Use of non-use of essential safety equipment 

 9Number and exposure time of bomb technicians and support 

personnel 

2) **Non-life threatening situations** 
- Normally remote procedure will be employed, particularly on closed bombs. 
- Hand  entry  procedures  are  not  recommended  and  must  be  justified  by  the  bomb 

  technician 

- Wait time will be used. 
- Limit initial response on the suspect package to one properly equiped technician with a minimum exposure time. 
- Rendering the item or situation safe may include the removal and/or transportation of the item to a remote area. 
- Suspect items that are transported to a range for render safe procedures and/or disposal no longer require emergency handling. Time is no longer a factor. Procedures used will be remote. Exposure time will be held to an absolute minimum. 
3) **No threat to life or property** 
- Employ remote procedures 
- Use wait time 

311\. **Priorities  while conducting search** 

- Public safety 
- Safety of the officer on the scene 
- Protection and preservation of public and private property 
- Collection and preservation of all evidence 
- Convenience to the public/restoration of service 

312\. **Basic principles of search** 

- Human life shall not be put in jeopardy over property. 
- Bomb  squad  response  is  a  minimum  of  one  two-man  tea  with  essential  safety equipment. 
- Only  bomb  squad  personnel  or  their  designees  will  be  permitted  within  the  bomb disposal operation area. 
- Paramedics and fire personnel shall be at the scene on stand-bu 
- Medical histories of all bomb technicians should be on file and updated. 

**Task Orientation** 

313\. The task performance will request following considerations : 

- Transport and dispose of hazardous materials. 
- Begin crime scene investigation. 
- Maintain condones off area (may be adjusted). 
- Photographs should be taken of both scene and device components Preserve evidence 
- Fingerprints are one of the most important types of evidence and must be preserved. 
- Wire ends cut by the bomb technician should be taped and marked for the laboratory. 
- Bomb components should be identified by the technician to assist in the immediate investigation. 
- A detailed report of the incident should accompany the components to the laboratory. 

**DO's and DONT's for IEDs and Mines** 

314\. Following Dos and Don'Ts are important and should be kept in mind always. 

1) Do not touch suspicious object or bomb 
1) Do not open the package with hand or other material 
1) Do not puncture the package or object 
1) Do not submerge the object in water. 
1) Do not cut the strings or wire. 
1) Do not pass the metallic object over the object or package. 
1) Do not accept the identification arks on the package on its face value. 
1) Do not use radio or wireless equipment in the vicinity of a suspicious object or bomb. 
1) Do not direct a flashlight on the suspicious object or bomb. 
1) Do not permit re entry of people until object is removed. 
1) Do not panic. 
1) Remain calm and walk out of the building in quit manner. 
1) Cut  off  gas  but  electric  supply  should  not  be  disturbed  as  it  can  detonate  the bomb/IED. 
1) Stop movement near the object. 
1) Inform the Bomb Disposal Squad or Police Control Room or nearest police Station or concerned authorities. 

**More points to remember** 

315\. Keep the following points in mind for the search otsutions : 

1) Keep telephone numbers of 
1. Police Control Room 
1. Important Police officers 

iii.Bomb Disposal Squad 

4. Fire Station 
4. Hospitals and 
4. Dog Squad. 
2) Do not be dead here. DO not touch the object 
2) Evacuate all people from the area if suspicious object is detected and inform Police Control Room. B.D. Squad and nearest Police Station. 
2) Report about the area and exact location where suspected object is found. 
2) Do not assume that only one bomb or IED is planted. 
2) Trust nothing and assume nothing is safe. 

**Search for Mines** 

316\. Look for the following this for searching mines : 

1) Look for disturbed and freshly dug earth. 
1) Look for dry grass used as camouflage 
1) Use mine detectors while moving in areas of suspicion. 
1) Ensure that the patrols move astride, the road and not on the road and be on the look out for mines. 
1) Look for trip wire and trip feelers/stick hooks. 
1) Wear body armour, helmets and mine goggles if available 
1) Train all security personnel to be mine/body trap conscious. 
1) Look for diert, grass sticks, dung or other material on roads. These areas can conceal mines. 
1) Look for signs of road repairs, new paving, patches, ditching or culvert work. Such areas may conceal mines. 
1) Watch for marks and signs such as sticks/stones placed in mine or clump of grass placed at intervals. 
1) Watch for wires leading away from the side of the road. 
1) Be careful in following explosed wire. It may be to lure you to a trap. 
1) Watch civilians and look for habitation. If there are signs of being abandoned, be alert. 
1) Be careful not to move over ruts or soft areas when moving on hard surfaced road. 
1) Have the leading vehicle of a group of vehicles or convoy empty except its driver. 
16) Mark, withdraw and report when a device is found. 

**DON'Ts** 

317\. Following Don'ts should be kept in mind. 

1) Bunch up during operations. 
1) Cut any wire unless the device is identified. 
1) Panic, but remain cool. 
1) Assume only one mine is planted. 
1) Try to be a dead hero. 

**Safety and Special Handling Precautions for Incendiaries** 

318\. Some improvised incendiary explosive mixtures are toxic by inhalation, absorption, or ingestion. Due to these factors, the following safety conditions should be adhered to:  

- Keep reactionary chemicals separated 
- Use only proper containers. 
- Be able to recognize chemical composition be size, color, or shape 
- Always work up wind. 
- Wear proper protective clothing and breathing apparatus as determined by threat level. 
- Never eat, drink, or smoke in an area of exposed chemicals. 
- Never carry improvised explosive mixtures in your bare hands. 
- Never accept labels for positive means of identification. 
- Never re-use containers found at a scene. 

**Safety Equipments while handling incendiaries** 

319\. The following safety equipment should be available any time improvised incendiary explosive mixtures are encountered: 

- Face mask or goggles 
- Gloves (depends on level of danger) 
- Flamc-proof clothing 
- Acid protection 
- Fire extinguisher 
- Eye wash 
- Fire blanket 
- Water supply

Chapter 257 

**VIP, Protocol and Ceremonial duties** 

**Introduction** 

320\. There are many important personages who due to their particular significance require special  security  and  protection  arrangements.  Such  people  are  called  VIPs  and  VVIPs. Hon'ble President of India and Prime Minister fall into the top category VVIPs. Likewise, other  defined  political  personages  and  Heads  of  the  States  of  various  nations  and  other identified persons also need special security arrangements. Similarly, there are persons who need to be given special protection coverage on the basis of security threats to their lives. One of the important duties of police is to provide security to all such persons and make several arrangements for them. Each State Police organization is responsible for the security arrangements to be made for their Hon'ble Governors and Chief Minister and other VIPs of the State. The State Government may issue instructions, in this regard, as per the exigencies and demands of the arrangements at their own level. 

**Main Tasks of VIP Duties** 

321\.  The  main  tasks  of  the  police  force  employed  on  duties  connected  with  the  Very Important Personas are following. 

1) to ensure the personal safety of the Very Important Personage, 
1) to  ensure  that  all  functions  immediately  concerned  with  the  visit  of  the  Very Important Personage and his movements pass off punctually and smoothly, 
1) to ensure that the public assembled on such occasions get full benefit of the very important Personage's visit and, 
1) that normal tranquility and law and order at the place are fully preserved to ensure that terrorist/extremist elements do not gain access to the  Very Important Personage. 

321\.1 During such arrangements there should be least show of police force, however, full protection  to  the  VIP  must  be  ensured  and  the  functions  should  pass  off  smoothly  and peacefully.  There  should  be  no  resentment  of  any  kind  in  the  public  regarding  the arrangements made by the authorities.    

257

321\.2 The objective of any such security arrangement should be to ensure that no danger or harm, deliberate or accidental, from living beings or from inanimate objects is carried near to the protected person, and that no person or object not confirmed to be safe or secure reaches near the protected person.  VIPs are often the target of extremist organisations, militant terrorist groups, disgruntled individuals, mentally disturbed individuals etc. The two main modes from where security threats can emanate are fire arms and various forms of explosive devices including remote control devices. An alert and efficient security system only can prevent the possibility of such danger  penetrating  security cover. Effective  anti-sabotage check and access control are useful factors in this regard. 

322\. **Anti Sabotage Check and Access Control** 

1. Anti-sabotage precautions along with access control constitute the cornerstone of any security arrangement for the protection of VIPs. Anti-sabotage check can be carried out by employing the following three methods: 
   1) Physical search (visual/manual) 
   1) Use of Technical gadgets (explosive detectors, Door Frame Metal Detectors, Mine sweeper etc.) 
   1) Use of sniffer dogs. 
1. Modern  aids  like  explosive  detectors,  metal  detectors  are  useful  and  must  be utilised  for  anti-sabotage  checks.  To  ensure  precautions  against  damage  from explosives  a  thorough  anti-sabotage  search  and  checking  of  the  camp,  venue, route and transport should b conducted. 

**Important Areas of VIP Security** 

323\. There are some important facets of V.I.P. duties. Important ones are following:-  

1. At the camp; 
1. Journey by road; 
1. Journey by train; 
1. Journey by air; 
1. Journey by steamer;     

258

6. Public functions; 
6. Liaison with the security officers accompanying the VIP. 
1) **At the Camp Duties**   
1. The VIP may be residing temporarily either in the Raj Bhavan, Guest House, or a private building. The degree of security would vary with the nature of residence. The lay out of the place should be studied and adequate lighting arranged. A thorough anti sabotage check should be conducted. Catering arrangements should be checked and staff deployed for these arrangements should be security vetted. 
1. A Camp Commandant (of appropriate rank) corresponding to the status of the very important personage may be designated. It will be the responsibility of the Camp Commandant to be in overall charge of the place of stay and be in contact with the concerned authorities/SPG/etc., wherever applicable. 
1. The Police Officers on guard duty should be fully conversant with the correct method of giving compliments and should have smart turn out. The guard should be posted in such  a  manner  that  police  are  not  very  much  in  the  public  gaze,  but  are  in  a commanding position to observe everything. 
1. Arrangements should be made for regulating and controlling a small crowd which may gather near the residence. The constables doing this duty should be tactful, yet firm, so that they can carry out their duty without giving offence and thereby causing any  embarrassment  to  the  VIP.  When  laying  out  security  arrangements  at  the residence, attention should be paid to overhanging roofs, balconies or trees which could be vantage points under certain circumstances. 
1. Officers in plain clothes should be detailed for security duty, the number depending upon the importance of the VIP, place of stay and other local conditions. Officers and men should be deployed for duties in outer, inner and isolation cordons, wherever necessary. 
1. Facilities  should  be  arranged  at  the  reception  point  and  entry  to  the  place  for 

   subjecting all persons/items to a thorough anti sabotage check. Installation of Door Frame Metal Detectors and use of Hand Held Metal Detectors and other equipment would be necessary. 

7. Alternative  arrangements  should  be  made  for  supply  of  power.  Fire  fighting  and medical arrangements should also be made. 

VIII.  Contingency exit and contingency Carcades should be arranged at the place of halt. 

Adequate communication facilities including setting up of wireless, hot lines, fax etc., may be arranged. 

2) **Journey by Road** 
1. Pilots and escort should be provided according to scale. The security box consisting of pilot car, VVIP car, escorts I & II, spare car should preferably be of the same make and colour. Wherever required (as per scale) the main and the spare car should be bullet-proof.  Instructions  given  in  various  circulars  as  regards composition of the Carcade for the President, Vice-president, Prime Minister and other dignitaries should be complied with.  
1. Vehicles should be subjected to thorough mechanical and anti-sabotage check. The antecedents of the drivers should be thoroughly verified and preference should be given to experienced drivers while finalising the scheme. Care should be taken to ensure that while finalising Carcade arrangements no deviations are allowed. Seating plans in the Carcade should be finalised well in advance and the drivers instructed to be always available near the vehicle. The drivers must also be briefed regarding the speed so that all vehicles of the Carcade keep pace with each other. 
1. The flag rod for flying the National flag/party flag, depending on the nature of the visit, should be fixed on the left side and not in the centre of the car bonnet. 
1. An assessment of the time to be taken during road journey from place to place should be carefully worked out. If the Carcade is likely to pass through areas with high-rise buildings, these buildings should be identified and staff posted. All unmarked and unattended vehicles on the route should be identified and action taken to remove them.  A thorough physical and anti-sabotage check of the route including culverts, bridges, drains, etc., will be necessary all along the route. Contingency routes and contingency hospitals and safe houses should be identified and the officers in the Carcade should be briefed regarding these arrangements. 
5. Very  often  the  VIP's  passage  is  held  up  by  enthusiastic  crowd  wanting  to  offer flowers or to request him to participate in a short function. Such contingencies should be anticipated by collection of intelligence and necessary security arrangements made without display of unnecessary uniformed policemen. When, however, a VIP makes an unscheduled halt, then the senior most police officer present at such places should make such security arrangements as could be commanded in such circumstances. 
5. The road, if it lies through a very heavily populated area and is of a considerable length,  should  be divided  into small sectors,  each  placed  under the charge of  an officer with his staff who are responsible for maintaining order in that sector. The officer should be constantly on the move, along the allotted sector. 
5. The constable posted for the duty should be given a manageable sector depending upon the anticipated crowd. It is his responsibility to control tactfully and with good mood that portion of the crowd which is in his sector. The co-operation of elders and responsible persons of the locality gathered there should be taken wherever possible to ensure orderly and disciplined behaviour on the part of the crowd. When large crowds gather along the route at certain places, strategic reserves should be kept to be used for controlling sudden increase of crowd which cannot be held back by the policemen already in the street. 

viii.  Officers are not expected to work with mathematical exactitude; all the same, they 

should  avoid  deploying  too  many  policemen  where  very  few  are  needed,  or requisitioning reserves when it is not necessary. It often happens that when the VIP continues his journey through thick crowds, the younger and enthusiastic elements of the  crowd  begin  to  run  behind  the  VIP's  vehicle  either  on  the  road  immediately behind the vehicle or on the sides of the road parallel to the vehicle. This is a very undesirable tendency and should be stopped by the policemen and officers standing along the route. 

324\. **Traffic Control and Regulation During Journey** 

1. The traffic points should be manned by traffic policemen as far as possible and should  be  reinforced  at  very  heavy  cross-roads  by  drawing  men  from  other stations. No traffic should be stopped but should be regulated unless a stoppage becomes  inevitable  for  the  security  of  the  VIP  and  smooth  running  of  his programme. If traffic is to be stopped at the cross-road, the officer on duty should see that the traffic is stopped just at the very last moment and when the stoppage takes place, it should be at some distance away from the cross-road. Instructions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs and concerned authorities from time to time should be carefully followed.  It may be necessary to declare certain streets closed to certain types of traffic. This matter should be considered in advance and decision taken. Also temporarily changing both-way traffic into one way has to be considered. It generally happens that after the motorcade of the VIP has passed the  traffic  arrangements  are  relaxed  or  almost  given  up.  This  causes  great hardship and inconvenience to other vehicular traffic which may be following or which may be held up temporarily. This aspect should be borne in mind and traffic should be controlled till the congestion is minimised and the normal traffic conditions are restored. 
1. While the V.I.P. passes through the rural areas, there may be slow moving traffic due to carts etc, therefore, adequate arrangements such as driving them on to a side, stopping them altogether or even unyoking the animals from the carts should be made. There may be certain roads which are narrow and winding in nature and hence stoppage of traffic particularly coming from the opposite direction may be necessary. The police officer on duty should decide how long before the arrival of the  VIP's  motorcade,  the  traffic  should  be  stopped  on  either  side  so  that  the oncoming traffic does not clash with the motorcade of the VIP. If there is traffic coming from the opposite direction which could not be stopped, each such vehicle coming from the opposite direction should be warned to keep to the extreme left of the road particularly at blind corners. 
3) **Journey by Train** 
1. When the VIP travels by a special train or saloon or in a reserved compartment attached to a train, an armed guard of such strength depending on the scale to which the VIP belongs or as the DIG/SP Railways decides, should accompany the VIP's train. This guard will be accommodated in a composite bogey which should be  placed  next  to  the  VIP's  saloon.  The  concerned  Superintendent  of  Police, Railways will be responsible to ensure that the VIP performs a safe journey by train  and  is  protected  from  the  attention  of  all  unauthorized  persons.  The assistance  of  the  local  police  should  be  taken  wherever  necessary.  The  VIP's saloon or compartment will be searched before the commencement of the journey by the security staff. After the anti sabotage check and until the train leaves, one sentry each on both the sides of the saloon to guard it should be posted. The armed guard will remain alert and keep a careful watch on all sides of the VIP's compartment.  
2. At all halts, one armed guard each on the rear and offside of the VIP's saloon will be posted. Unauthorized persons will be prevented from approaching the saloon or the compartment. The crowd will be kept at a reasonable distance.  When the VIP travels by special train, the platforms of all railway stations where he does not halt or alight should be kept clear. 
2. At  railway  junctions  or  other  large  stations  where  the  special  train  stops,  the Railway Police/ Sub-inspector of Police/ Inspector having jurisdiction will post constables on the platform to augment the train guard to the extent necessary. If a long halt is made at any station and the VIP continues to occupy the train on a siding,  the  armed  guard  escorting  the  VIP  will  mount  guard  on  the  saloon occupied  by  the  VIP  and  the  Railway  Sub-inspector/Police  Inspector  having jurisdiction will arrange relief.  If the halt is only for a short time, say two or three minutes, or if the train stops outside a station on account of signal or any other cause, the guard will not be mounted at the saloon itself, but one constable will take  the  position  on  each  side  of  the  compartment  and  look  along  the  train towards the saloon.  
2. The Superintendent of Police, Railways, will be responsible for seeing that proper police arrangements are made en route. He should be in touch with the district police  for  augmentation  of  staff  at  stations  of  halts,  interchange,  arrival  and departure. Ordinarily, there should not be any patrolling of the railway track, but when  the  Deputy  Inspector  General,  Railways,  or  the  Superintendent  of  the district  considers  it  necessary;  detailed  sections  will  conduct  patrolling.  The Railway Police Sub-Inspector/Inspector will travel in his jurisdiction in the same train as the VIP and the Superintendent of Police, Railways, will travel in the same train, if specially ordered.  
5. At  stations  of  arrival  and  departure  the  local  police  will  make  security arrangements outside the platform- The Railway police will see that the platform exits and entrances are kept free from undesirable persons.  The local police and the Railway Police will be responsible for the VIP's security at all halting stations. Escorts of High Personages will be relieved by the respective Railway Police escorts when the VIP travels to different states. 
4) **Journey by Air** 

325\. Sufficient uniformed police should be kept on duty at the airport at the time of arrival or departure of the VIP with a view to preventing unauthorised persons from crowding too near the person of the VIP. Plain clothes officers should also be present. The airfield and its entrance should be kept clear of all the unauthorised persons, care being taken not to cause any  inconvenience  to  bonafide  air  passengers.  Police  arrangements  to  keep  the  landing ground clear of any object or obstruction likely to hinder safe landing should also be made. The  police  guard  should  prevent  any  unauthorised  person  from  having  access  to  the aeroplane. The existing arrangements at the Airport should be studied and parking bay of the VIP aircraft should be checked. If any reception line up has been arranged care should be taken  to  ensure  that  no  unauthorised  persons  gain  access.   When  the  VIP  travels  by Helicopter, guidelines laid down for construction of helipads should be complied with. All precautions prescribed for journey by helicopter should be followed as stipulated. 

5) **Journey by Steamer** 

326\. At the pier, adequate uniformed police arrangements should be made by the local police to prevent unauthorised persons from approaching the VIP and for the maintenance of law and order. 

6) **Public Functions** 
1. A  VIP's  visit  is  generally  associated  with  a  public  meeting.  The  nature  and 

   magnitude of arrangements depend upon the status, prevailing condition and place of such public meeting. These and all aspects connected with a public meeting should  be  thoroughly  examined  and  appropriate  security  and  bandobust arrangements made.  

2. The venue, date, time and duration of the meeting should be ascertained well in advance. The organisers of the public meeting should be contacted and their full co-operation  secured.  It  is  always  advantageous  to  visit  the  place  of  public meeting a few days in advance of the  meeting and discuss all  aspects of the function with the organisers so that proper arrangements could be made not only by the police but also by the organisers and other Government departments or public bodies  
2. Advance intelligence should be collected so that preventive action could be taken to prevent anti social elements from creating a breach of the peace. The approach roads to the venue of meeting should be kept clear. Loudspeaker arrangements should be tested well in advance so as to ensure that all the assembled members of the public can clearly and distinctly hear the VIP. A spare set of equipment should be kept standby. The exit and entrance of the VIP should be without hindrance. Where  possible,  the  exit  and  entrance  of  the  VIP  and  VIP's  party  should  be separate from those meant for the general public and other invitees.  Depending upon the crowd and venue of the meeting, sufficient number of exits should be provided so that the public and the invitees may leave the place quickly and in an orderly manner.  
2. The seating of the VIP should be such that all those invited and others in the assembly can have a clear view of the VIP.  It is always desirable that the VIP's seat is on a raised platform or rostrum and the distance between him and the general crowd is such as to ensure the security and free movement of the VIP. If guidelines so stipulate, a sterile area should be kept in front of the rostrum. This rostrum should be under the protection of a guard from the time the programme has been finalised. Rostrum should be subjected to thorough anti-sabotage check of the number of persons who need to be near the rostrum should be determined well  in  advance.  Where  the  entry  to  a  public  meeting  is  not  regulated  by invitations, the distance from the platform or the rostrum to the crowd should not be less than 10 metres.   
5. The number of persons to be seated on the platform or rostrum should be kept to the minimum and should be such as to ensure security of the VIP. Barricades, where necessary, should be put up and in doing so, it should be ensured that passages  are  left  for  easy  ingress  and  egress  and  that  separate  enclosures  are reserved for women and children. Adequate reserve police, where necessary with necessary  lathies,  arms  and  tear  gas  equipment  should  be  kept  in  the neighbourhood of the venue of the public meeting.  
5. The officers and men posted to control the crowd in such meetings should be adequately familiarized with their duties. They should be tactful but firm. The tendency  to  blow  whistles  and  brandishing  of  lathies  should  be  avoided.  The tendency of the police officers to congregate near the VIP should be deprecated and each officer should stick to his sphere and sector of duty.  
5. Sufficient and definite space should be allotted for parking cars and other vehicles of not only VIP's and invitees but also of the general public. Separate parking place for the VIP convey should be earmarked which should be guarded properly.  Arrangements for parking cars and vehicles should be such that the cars of and other dignitaries could be summoned at a moment's notice.   

VIII.  Appropriate bandobust schemes should be drawn up fixing the responsibility of 

each  officer  and  be  circulated  among  all  concerned.   The  officers  and  staff detailed for duty should be at their positions well in advance of the start of the meeting.  It is also desirable to check the bandobust arrangements a few hours before  the**  meeting  for  ensuring  their  proper  implementation.   Arrangements should also be made for a stand-by system of power supply both for the function and public address system.   Adequate number of fire extinguishers may be made available at the venue of public meeting.     

IX.  Access control is very vital in all public functions.   Adequate number of Door Frame Metal Detectors, Hand Held Metal Detectors etc., may be installed. In 

addition to this staff may also be deployed for subjecting all persons attending the function for physical check. Contingency planning should be made to meet any emergent measures.   An officer should be exclusively assigned for being in over all charge and control of all the arrangements at the place of function. 

**The Scale and Quantum of Security Arrangements**  

327\. The extent of security arrangements depends upon the importance of the VIP and the local  conditions.  Where  special  instructions  are  issued  by  Government  of  India,  State** Government, or the Director General those instructions should also be followed. 

1. **President of India-** Security arrangements will be provided in accordance with the instructions contained in the booklet "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the person of the President when on tour, including short residences in Simla".  
1. **Vice President of India -** Security arrangements will be provided in accordance with the instructions contained in the book "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the 
1. **Prime  Minister-**  Security  arrangements  will  be  provided  in  accordance  with  the instructions contained in the blue book "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the person of the Prime Minister of India when on tour and in travel."  
1. **Ministers of the Central Government -** The Commissioner in Bangalore City and the Superintendents in the district are responsible for the security arrangements in this connection with visits of the Ministers of the Central Government. Necessary security arrangements  will  be  made  for  guarding  the  residence  and  for  protection  during journeys by road, rail and air and at public functions as provided in** the "Rules and Instructions for the protection of the Ministers of the Central Government when in residence and on tour".  

**Arrangements for Special Categories of the Protected Persons** 

328\. Security arrangements will be provided in accordance with the instructions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to individuals who have been categorised depending upon threat perception as per the scale prescribed below: 

**Category  Scale of Security**

Chapter 270 

**Disaster Management Duties** 

**Introduction**

Ministry of Home Affairs is the nodal Ministry in the Government of India.  National Disaster  Management  Authority  has  issued  detailed  guidelines  for  preparation  of  State Disaster Management Plans including the role of State Disaster Management Authority /State Executive  Committee  and  the  State  department  for  disaster  response.   These  guidelines include vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, preventive measures, preparedness measures and the response and Disaster specific Action Plan.  

India is vulnerable in varying degrees to a large number of natural as well as man-made disasters- 58.6 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity; over 40 million hectares(12 per cent of land) is prone to floods and river erosion; of the 7,516 km long coastline, close to 5,700 km is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; 68 per cent of the cultivable area is vulnerable to drought and hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches.  Further, the vulnerability to Nuclear, Biological and Chemical(NBC) disasters and terrorism has also increased manifold.  

**Disaster Risks in India** 

Disaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities, due to a variety of factors.  These include the ever-growing population, the vast disparities in income, rapid  urbanisation,  increasing  industrialisation,  development  within  high-risk  zones, environmental degradation, climate change, etc.  Clearly, all these point to a future where disasters seriously threaten India’s population, national security, economy and its sustainable development; therefore the urgency to issue the guidelines for the preparation of the State Plan for Disaster Management(DM) as mandated by the disaster Management Act, 2005 (DM ACT, 2005).  The DM plans will build in region and hazard specific management tools in the context of regional and multi-hazard vulnerabilities.  

270

**Past Initiatives**  

The High Powered Committee 

The  first  initiative  towards  formulating  a  systematic,  comprehensive  and  holistic approach to all disasters, was the setting up of a High Powered Committee (HPC) in August 1999 under the Chairmanship of Shri J.C.Pant.  The HPC prepared comprehensive model plans for DM at the national, state and district levels.  

**The National Committee on Disaster Management**. 

An all party National Committee on Disaster Management(NCDM) was set up after the  Gujarat  earthquake,  under  the  Chairmanship  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  with representatives of national and state level political parties, for catalysing and enabling the preparation of DM plans and suggesting effective mitigation mechanisms.  

**The Disaster Management Act, 2005** 

On 23 December 2005, the Government of India(GoI) took a defining step towards holistic DM by piloting the enactment of the DM ACT,2006.  

The DM Act, 2005 – A Paradigm Shift. 

The DM Act, 2005, mandates a paradigm shift from a response and relief-centric approach, to a proactive, and comprehensive mindset towards DM covering all aspects from prevention, mitigation, preparedness to rehabilitation, reconstruction and recovery.  

It also provides for:  

- The  creation  of  a  policy,  legal  and  institutional  framework,  backed  by  effective statutory and financial support. 
- The mainstreaming of multi-sectoral DM concerns into the development process and mitigation measures through projects.  

271

- A  continuous  and  integrated  process  of  planning,  organising,  coordinating  and implementing  policies  and  plans  in  a  holistic,  community  based  participatory, inclusive and sustainable manner.  

**National Vision**  

The national vision is a build a safer and disaster resilient India by developing a holistic,  proactive,  multi-disaster  and  technology  driven  strategy  for  DM.   This  will  be achieved through a culture of prevention, mitigation and preparedness to reduce the impact of disasters on people.  The entire process will centre stage the community and will be provided momentum  and  sustenance  through  the  collective  efforts  of  all  government  agencies supported by Non-Governmental Organisations(NGOs).  

**Role of the National Disaster Management Authority(NDMA)**  

The  DM  Act  mandates  the  NDMA  to  lay  down  policies  and  guidelines  for  the statutory  authorities  to  draw  their  plans.   In  essence,  the  NDMA  will  concentrate  on prevention,  mitigation,  preparedness,  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  and  also  formulate appropriate policies and guidelines for effective and synergised national disaster response and relief.  It will coordinate the enforcement and implementation of policies and plans.  

**The  Role  of  the  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  (SDMA)  State  Executive Committee(SEC) and the State Departments.**  

Section 23 of the DM Act, 2005 provides that there shall be a DM plan for every state.  It outlines the broad coverage of the plan aswell as the requirement of consultation in the preparation of the state plans.  It also provides for annual review and updating of the state plan, and enjoins upon the state governments to make provisions for financing the activities to  be  carried  out  under  the  state  plans.   It  provides  for  the  departments  of  the  state governments to draw up their own plans in accordance with the state plan.  The state plans shall be prepared by the SEC  in conformity with the guidelines to  be  issued on related matters by the SDMA having regard to the guidelines laid down in this regard by the NDMA, and after such consultation with local and district authorities and the people’s representatives as the SEC may deem fit.  The state plan prepared by SEC shall be approved by the SDMA.  

**Need for Immediate Action**  

Ideally,  state  DM  plans  should  be  made  after  vulnerability  assessment  and  risk analysis of a state have been undertaken.  Guidelines issued by the NDMA will also need to be internalised in these plans.  Even though this process has begun, it is likely to take some time.  It is felt that the preparation of plans cannot, and should not, await the outcome the disaster risk analysis.  On the basis of extant information and knowledge, a plan should be formulated by every state and updated regularly adding fresh inputs on an ongoing basis.  Pending  detailed  micro-level  vulnerability  assessment  and  risk  analysis,  information  as currently  available  about  the  vulnerability  profile  of  different  areas  of  a  state,  including information contained in the vulnerability atlas of India published by the Ministry of Urban Development may be incorporated in the plan.  

State profile- social, economic and demographic 

- Vision 
- Theme 
- Objectives 

Vulnerability Assessment and Risk Analysis  

- History of vulnerability of the state to different types of natural disasters. 
- Hazard risk assessment and vulnerability mapping. 
- The probable threat and types of man made disasters. 
- A  hazard  profile  of  the  state  together  with  maps  and  details  of  zonation,  if  any, undertaken.  The  district  hazard  profile  in  GIs  format  should  also  be  included,  if available.  The plan should also refer to emerging concerns such as urbanisation, environment protection, population explosion etc.  

**Preventive Measures**  

- Natural Disasters – specific to the state. 
- Man made disasters. 
- Early warning and dissemination systems. 
- Prevention and mitigation plans; short, medium and long term with structural and non-structural  measure  required  to  be  taken  together  with  identification  of  nodal department(s) for each activity.  

Training needs analysis and development of state HR plan.  

**Mainstreaming DM Concerns into Development Plans/ Programme/ Projects**. 

- This  includes  economic  and  social  infrastructure  like  irrigation,  power,  drinking water,  sanitation,  roads,  buildings,  schools  and  hospitals,  housing,  heritage monuments, etc.  
- Elements of impact assessment, risk reduction, and the ‘do no harm’ approach to be built into the developmental plans of each department while building in DM concerns into such plans. 
- Classification of disasters and residual agenda.

**Correspondence**

**Introduction** 

411\.  Communication  is  fundamental  to  official  working  and  functioning.  The  official communication can be oral or in writing. The communication made in writing is called as correspondence in official parlance. Correspondence should be simple, clear,  cogent and effective. There are some formal rules which are required to be observed while  making official  correspondence.  Some  of  the  general  rules  of  correspondence  are  mentioned herewith.  

412\. **General Rules ![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.014.png)**

1. The name as well as the official designation of an officer should be set out at the head  of  every  letter  or  proceedings  issued  by  him  or  from  his  office.  Every correspondence  should  be duly  signed  by the  concerned officer. However,  an authorized  subordinate  officer  may  sign  it,  once  the  draft  of  the  letter  or proceedings has been approved on the file.  The use of facsimile signature stamps in  lieu  of  manual  signature  in  regular  correspondence  is  forbidden.  Official documents should be signed in a uniform and legible manner.  Initials and full signatures should always be dated, with the year as well as the date and month being shown on each correspondence. 
1. Complete address of the addressee should be written including the pin code.   In case a particular officer has to see the letter, the letter should be addressed to the concerned office but caption added on the first page of the letter as: Kind Attn: Sri (Name)  just below the official address.   Wherever it is urgent and necessary to seek orders from DGP Office in any matter, Unit Officers should write letter and sent it in name cover to the concerned Officer dealing with the subject in DGP, Office.  
1. Telegrams  and  telephones  should  not  be  used  when  police  communication networks or e-mail or fax machines can be used. Wireless messages should be sent in the manner prescribed in this regard.  

294

4. The postage for all letters dispatched by Government officers in their official capacity in reply to communications of any kind received from private individuals or associations should be at government cost. 

**Signing of Official Communications** 

413\. Notifications and orders including that addressed to members of the public, issued in the exercise of statutory powers, should be duly signed both on the office copies and the fair copies by the officers empowered to issue them and not by any other officers on their behalf. All communications addressed to Government or superior officers should be signed by the officers concerned or by the officers specially authorised to sign on behalf of the officer concerned. Initials and signatures should always be dated, the year as well as the date and month being shown. All communications should contain the name of the officer signing the communication either typewritten or legibly written in brackets, below the signature. When a large  number  of  enclosures  are  sent  with  a  letter,  a  list  of  such  enclosures  should  be forwarded.  Urgent  letters  should  be  dispatched  by  speed  post/express  delivery.  Courier system can be used rarely in extremely exceptional and urgent situations. 

**Classification of Correspondence** 

414\. The official correspondence can be classified broadly as follows :-

1. **Top Secret** - This marking is reserved for papers containing information of such a nature that for reasons of national security, it must only be disclosed to persons whose duty makes it essential that they should have knowledge of it. Such papers include references  to  current  or  future  military  operations,  impending  movements  or dispositions  of  the  armed  forces  and  shipping  and  secret  methods  of  warfare,  to matters of high political policy and to methods of secret intelligence and cyphers.  
1. **Secret** - This marking is reserved for papers other than those marked tcs secret which are of such a nature that their disclosure to persons other than those whose duty is to have knowledge of them, would cause administrative embarrassment or difficulty or would  be  helpful  to  the  enemy,  without  being  gravely  dangerous  to  the  national interest.  
1. **Confidential**  -  This  marking  is  reserved  for  papers  containing  information  the circulation of which is desirable to restrict, for administrative reasons and which do 

296

not disclose such vital information as to warrant their inclusion in the secret category.  

4. **Private**  -  It  means,  not  to  be  placed  in  an  official  file  or  referred  to  in  official correspondence'. Papers so marked should be kept by the recipient so long as they are required and then destroyed.  
4. **Personal** - It means not to be opened by any one except the officer named on the cover and to be returned to the sender if the addressee is not available. 

**The Precautions** 

415\. All Top Secret' 'Secret' and 'Confidential' papers should invariably be sent in double covers The Security marking should be indicated on the inner cover only (and not on top cover) and should be properly sealed and addressed by name to the officer for whom it is intended The top cover should bear only the official address. If sent by hand delivery through an assistant or a clerk only a single cover may be used in which case the cover should be carefully sealed and clearly marked with the correct name, address and security marking. When such papers are sent by a messenger they should be closed in double covers. Economy labels should not be used on the inner covers containing Top Secret, Secret and 'Confidential' documents. They should be used on outer covers only. 

**Address on Envelops and Covers of Official Correspondence**  

416\. Covers containing official correspondence which is not of a confidential nature should be addressed to the officer for whom they are intended by his official designation only and without the addition of his name. All Top Secret' 'Secret and 'Confidential documents should be placed in strong covers and where the contents are bulky, cloth-lined covers should be used. Letters or packets containing Top Secret', 'Secret', and 'Confidential' papers, when sent by post, should invariably be registered and sent 'Acknowledgement Due;. Even when they are sent by hand delivery the signature of the recipient should be obtained in token of his having received the documents. Parcels or envelopes containing Top Secret' or 'Secret papers should be placed in a canvas bag while sending to the post office. They should be sent by insured post, if necessary.  Top Secret papers should be   opened   only by the officer for whom they are intended or by an officer who is dealing with his work in his absence. 'Secret' or 'Confidential papers should be opened only by the officer for whom they are intended or by the officer who has been authorised to do so or who is looking after the work in his 

absence.   In no case should such papers be opened by an officer other than a superior officer.

**Disclosure of the Identity of Sources** 

417\. No record or information which relates to, or which leads or may lead to the discovery of the identity of the source from which or of any agent or informant from whom any secret information has been or may be obtained shall be communicated by any Police Officer to any other member of the police force to which he belongs, except as provided below:

1. The State Intelligence as well as the CID may communicate secret information to such persons, other than members of the police force within the State as are approved by the Government, lists of whom shall be  maintained in the State Intelligence and the CID respectively.

   the case may be. In urgent cases, however, the Superintendents, may, in anticipation of approval, communicate such information to an officer of corresponding or higher rank in a police force outside the State, either in response to an enquiry from such officer or on his own  initiative when the delay caused  by  communicating  through  the usual  channel  is likely to be prejudicial to the peace and security of the district concerned or the area to which the secret information is to be sent.

On no account should it be quoted in the issue of orders to subordinate officials.  Demi-official  communications  or  instructions,  which  are  provisionally required for action or record, must be supplemented by official communications containing no reference to the demi-official correspondence. Demi-official covers should ordinarily be addressed to the officer for whom they are intended, both by his name and by his official designation. If the officer addressed by name has vacated his appointment, his successor or locum-tenens should open such covers and deal with the communications enclosed, if he is competent to do so. Demi- official covers which are intended to be opened by the addressee and by no one else should be  enclosed in covers addressed  to him  by name only, his official designation being omitted.

**Chapter **325**** 

**Inspection** 

**Introduction** 

449\. Observation, assessment and evaluation of the work and performance for analyzing the quality, quantity and standard of work and performance, are necessary to provide speed and dynamism to the functioning of any organization.  Inspection is such a tool by which the seniors not only observe the working of their subordinates, but they also make an evaluation of the positive and negative aspects of the their performance.  Inspection, thus, becomes and effective mechanism of feed back and follow up with regard to working and performance of any unit and its personnel. Inspection, as an effective and efficient supervisory style for organizational development, personnel growth and performance evaluation, should be used and utilized on a regular basis with objectivity and without any prejudice, bias and pre- conceived notions. It should not be used only as a fault finding technique. It should rather be utilized as a sound system for arranging removal of errors and as a positive set of guidance for better performance in future.    

**Objects and Aims of Police Inspections** 

450\. Inspection of offices and police stations by superior officers is one of the effective methods by which the efficiency of the force can be raised. It is, in fact, the only way by which the superior officer can come to know his subordinates by personal contact, their standard of work, and their personal difficulties on the one hand, and the general state of crime, standard of investigation and preventive work on the other. The object of inspections should, therefore, be not to criticize and find fault with the work of the subordinates  but  to  suggest  or  take  measures  for  the  improvement  of  police administration  and  quality  improvement  in  the  service  delivery  in  their  work  and functioning. 

**Scale of Inspections** 

451\. The heads of offices are required to make a detailed inspection of their offices at least once a year to ensure that their offices are functioning properly and efficiently. In addition, the officers should inspect every year in detail the police stations and the offices of their 

325

subordinates in accordance with the scale prescribed from time to time. The govt. and the D.G. of Police will prescribe the scale of inspections, the inspecting authorities, and the mode of inspection of their related matters. The inspections should also be supplemented by surprise checks and visits, with a view to ensuring that the defects pointed out at the time of inspection have been rectified and that there is general improvement in the standard of work. 

452\. **Programme of Inspection** 

1. Inspection should be conducted in a systematic, scientific and methodical manner. Inspections done by fits and starts and hurried through at the tail end of the year or half-year will not serve any real purpose nor do they enable the officers to judge and gauge the work of their subordinates. 
1. Inspection should be properly spaced out and spread over the year or half-year, as the case may be, particularly the first ten months (or five months) in the year (or half-year) leaving the last two months (or one month) for unforeseen and urgent work. The inspecting  officer  should  make  sufficiently long  halts  and conduct detailed inspections. For this purpose, the inspecting officers should chalk out regular programme of inspections during the ensuing year well in advance and adhere to it. 
1. Each  Superintendent  or  unit  officer,  as  the  case  may  be,  should  finalize  his programme  of  inspection  and  obtain  the  approval  of  the  concerned  Zone Inspector  General  by  the  15th  of  December  and  send  copies  to  the  Director General. While finalizing the programme of inspections, care should be taken by the Superintendent or the unit officer concerned to see that the inspection of the same office/police station/unit by more than one officer do not fall on the same day  or  at  the  same  time.  There  should  be  a  reasonable  gap  between  two inspections of the same unit. 
1. Each  Assistant  Superintendent/Deputy  Superintendent  should  finalize  his programme of inspection and send it to the Superintendent/unit officer, as the case  may  be,  by  1st  December  which  should  be  scrutinized  by  the Superintendent/unit officer concerned subject to such changes as he considers necessary with a view to avoiding a clash of programme. 

327

5. The programme should be so chalked out as to include the maximum number of offices  in  the  same  visit.  The  inspection  should  be  done  periodically  and systematically. Neither the same office should be inspected too often nor do the others completely neglect. 
5. All  the  police  officers  should  be  present  in  ceremonial  uniform  during  the inspection unless otherwise ordered by the inspecting officer. 

453\. **Inspection of a District by the Director General/ Addl.DGP** 

1. The  S.P.  in  order  to  enable  the  Director  General/ADG  to  gauge  the  general situation of a district should supply information in the prescribed Performa. The Director General/ADG may direct the Superintendent to prepare such additional statements as he may require for his inspection. 
1. The  other  officers  whose  units  or  offices  are  inspected  should  keep  such information as is necessary and as may be required for purposes of inspection. 
1. During his inspection visit to the headquarters of a district, the Director General will inspect the police at a ceremonial parade. The parade should be arranged on a convenient day so that maximum numbers of officers are available. 
1. As far as possible, the Superintendent must command the ceremonial parade. If he is unable to do so, he may depute another suitable officer to command the parade in which case he should receive the reviewing officer as he arrives at the parade ground. 
1. After the ceremonial parade is over, the officers and men may be tested in such drill, use of arms and training exercises as the inspecting officer decides. For this purpose all accessories used in training and drill should be kept handy for being used. Armoury, stores and the entire fleet of police motor transport in the district should be available for his inspection. 
1. All officers of and above the rank of Sub-Inspectors, including those working in 

   the Railway Police, Wireless, and other police units stationed at the place of inspection and Inspectors and above stationed in other parts of the district should be called to meet the Director General/ADG during his inspection/visit to the headquarters of a district.   

7. Arrangements should be made so that MLAs, MLCs and MPs of the district and such officials and non-officials as may desire may meet the DGP. During the inspection visits to the headquarters and other places of the district, the Director General will meet as many retired police officers as would like to meet him. 

VIII.  Copies  of  inspection  notes  of  the  Director  General/ADG  will  be  sent  to  the 

Superintendent concerned with copies to the zone Inspector General and police station or office concerned. The Superintendent will ensure compliance of the instructions issued and send a report to the Director General through his range Inspector General. 

454\. **Inspection by the Zone/Range IGP/Deputy Inspector General** 

1. Zone  Inspector  General/Range  DIG  should  spend  at  least  one  week  for  the inspection of the District, Armed reserve and all branches of the office of the Superintendent, the office of the Sub-Divisional Police Officer, the Circle Police Offices and the Police Stations in the district headquarters. He should, in addition, spend sufficient time for inspection of other police stations in the district. 
1. The same police stations and circle offices should not be inspected repeatedly year after year but should be taken in rotation.  The inspection of the Range Inspector  General  should  be  thorough  and  should  cover  all  aspects  of  police work. The one item of inspection in a district should be ceremonial parade. After the ceremonial parade, the parade could be broken up into small units  and a particular unit directed to perform a particular drill. He should pay particular attention  to  the  standard  maintained  regarding  P.T.,  assault  course,  obstacle course, lathi drill, guards and escort duties, mob-control and fitness exercises.  Superior officers, Police Inspectors and Sub-Inspectors should be tested for their ability to take parade, impart instructions and command the men under them.  
3. The  armoury,  stores  and  motor  transport  should  be  inspected  in  detail.  The inspection of District Police Office should be a detailed one covering the work of all  branches  including  accounts  and  establishment.   While  inspecting  district special branch, DCIB and district crime record bureau, he should review the state of crime, the collection and filing of special branch/ intelligence wing. 
3. The Inspecting Officer should inspect all the personal and confidential files and sheets  maintained  by  the  Superintendent  including  confidential  and  secret documents.  The  Inspector/Deputy  Inspector  General  should  pay  particular attention  to  the  maintenance  of  discipline,  speedy  disposal  of  departmental proceedings. Award of adequate punishments and prompt rewarding of those who have  done  good  work  are  some  of  the  points  which  should  be  examined thoroughly.  Police  buildings  and  lines  should  be  inspected  with  a  view  to ensuring  their  proper  maintenance.  Due  attention  to  the  welfare  activities organized for the benefit of police officers and their families should be given proper and judicious use of the benevolent fund should be ensured. 
3. All officers of and above the rank of Sub-Inspectors including those working in the Railway Police, Police Wireless, and other police units stationed at the place of inspection and Inspectors and above, stationed in other parts of the district should be called to meet the Range Inspector General during his inspection/visit to the headquarters of the district.  Arrangements should be made for the Range Inspector General to meet MLAs, MLCs, and MPs residing in the district and such officers and non-officials as may desire to meet him.  During the inspection visits to the headquarters and other places of the district, the Range Inspector General will meet as many retired police officers as would like to meet him. It is not necessary for the Superintendent or the Deputy Superintendent to be present during the inspection by the Range Inspector General except at the headquarters of the district or sub-division, as the case may be.  
3. After completing the inspection of a district he should write a comprehensive report on the district as a whole and also detailed note in respect of each of the units including police stations inspected by him. Copies of his inspection notes should be sent to the Director General along with his comprehensive report on the district. Copies of inspection notes of police stations and units will be sent to the Superintendent and the office concerned for compliance of instructions issued in the notes within a period of one month. 

**Inspection by Superintendent of the District** 

455\. The inspection by the Superintendent should cover all aspects of police work including stores, accounts, accommodation and kit. Inspections should be systematic and as far as possible,  be  carried  out  by  circles  and  there  should  be  sufficient  interval  between  the inspection of a circle by the Superintendent and that by the Sub-Divisional Police Officer.  He should halt at the places of inspection sufficiently long and not less than 3 days in the case of police stations to enable him to get a thorough grasp of local conditions and crime and a full knowledge of the work of his subordinates.  An outpost should as far as possible to inspect during the inspection of the parent police station.  The Superintendent should inspect the men on parade and test them in drill. He should inspect all buildings, residential and non- residential,  as  well  as  buildings  under  construction  and  sites  selected  or  earmarked  for construction of police buildings. He should hold kit inspection and condemn such articles of clothing as have become unserviceable.

**Chapter **335**** 

**Police Public Relations & Community Policing**  

**Introduction** 

457\. Police organisation, in a democratic polity can discharge its duties effectively only with the  cooperation  of  the  people.  Public  assistance  is  needed  for  prevention,  detection, investigation  and  prosecution  of  cases,  and  also  for  maintaining  peace  during  all  major social,  cultural,  economic  and  political  events.  For  eliciting  and  sustaining  such  a  co- operation constant interaction with the members of the public needs to be maintained by professional public relations set up within the organization. Police are an important wing of the executive. They are the primary law enforcement agency. The execution of police duties presupposes citizen and public support to police. Police need assistance of the public as witnesses,  informers  and  supporters.  The  police  should  therefore  endeavor  to  create impression in the public that they are their friends and are there to help them in case of need. The intention to serve the public to understand the problems of others and a commitment to job are bound to earn laurels for beneficial public relationship leading to healthy police public relations.  

458\. **Organization and Structure of Police PR Wing**

DGP (L&O) may be in charge of the public relations work at the PHQ. Professionals in print and visual media, as well as, advertising will be part of the PR set up at state police headquarters. The public relations officers in the district may be drawn from police officers of the rank of Inspector or from among professionals on deputation/contract.

All  PROs,  either  from  the  police  or  on  deputation  may  undergo  a  two-week orientation course in a professional PR Institute and one-week orientation course to be designed and implemented by training colleges with suitable curriculum with essential features of police public relations. 
2. The overall profile of the police department and its PR objectives are to be borne in mind in all PR interactions PR wing should be attuned to serve the interests of the public and the goals of the organization. Since the services to be rendered are linked  closely  with  the  lives,  possessions,  liberties,  rights  and  honor  of  all persons, it is all the more necessary that the public relation functions become a part of the police organization's work.

**Internal Efforts**

460\. No amount of effort in public relations will yield the desired results unless it starts first with the police personnel themselves. With a view to developing better internal relations publications of various types can be published and circulated among the staff.

460\.1 **In House Journal, Magazine and Publications :** This is a channel of communication for the police personnel of all ranks to get themselves acquainted with the police functioning in all respects. It provides a medium for expression of views and communication of various developments in the department from time to time. It is also a means by which the personnel can communicate with one another. The contents of these print outs should be devoted to discussion on police duties, personnel problems, cases of good work, updating of knowledge, and the views of the public. The policies of the department and the legal changes are also incorporated in the departmental publications. Publications provide a reading material for policemen  and  their  families.  Such  activities  should  run  with  regular  staff  headed  by  a Manager of the rank of an Addl. SP. The staff needed for printing, binding, packing and despatch can be contract appointments.  

**Strengthening Police Publication Efforts** 

461\. Following activities can strengthen the police publication efforts. 

![ref10]  Every  police  officer  should  become  a  life  member  of  State  Police  Journal  by ![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.019.png)

contribution at the subsidized rates. 

![ref8]  The Journal should distribute direct to the entire member. ![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![ref12]![ref5]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.020.png)![ref7]

- The free distribution should be limited to all police training institutions, stations and ![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]police officers for record and use. 
- Apart  from  regular  publication  of  the  State  Police  Journal,  the  printing  press  of ![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]police should be utilized for publication of other literature useful to the department as well as informative to the public.  

![ref8]  A video magazine of the Journal with necessary visuals and live commentaries and ![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.021.png)![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]

interviews should be compiled and released every month.  

**PR as Part of Police Training** 

462\. The training programmes of the Constables and other police officers should include a module  on  public  relations  both  at  the  district  training  centres  as  also  in  other  training institutions. Lectures should be organised on PR to the trainees in the training institutions as well  as in  the  district training  centres by  professional  public  relations  officers.  Stickers, motivation posters for different categories of officers and a short poster on code of conduct, do's and don'ts for field police officers displayed at all police station, training institutions, inside the police buildings, police rest houses, barracks, parade ground etc. should be done to improve the communication with the employees. Bulletin board is an effective medium of internal communication which serves the purpose of talking to the personnel and listening by the  personnel.  This  has  to  be  a  permanent  information  fixture  particularly  in  the  police stations, control rooms, police headquarters of the districts/cities and the headquarter of the battalions and the police training institutions. 

**External Public Relations** 

463\. The Deputy Inspector General of Police, Public Relations and the PROs should .be in regular  touch  with  the  Information  and  Public  Relations  Department  of  the  State Government,  Door-Darsan,  All  India  Radio,  the  Directorate  of  Field  Publicity  of  the Government of India etc. and organize publicity for all the good work done by the police since positive work usually does not readily attract the attention of the media. The external public  relations  campaign  should  be  designed  to  inform,  educate,  build  awareness  and confidence in the minds of the public by adopting the following methods. 

1. **Educative slogans:** These can be publicized through posters, hoardings, newspapers, radio, television, and printed literature, and electronic display, meetings with voluntary bodies, audio visuals and direct interaction with public. 
1. **Newspapers:** This is a powerful media and is read by a large number of people and still those who read and discuss about what they read influence a larger number. Regular press releases in a neat format containing information from time to time on important policy  decisions,  events,  bundobusts,  crime  information,  clarifications,  traffic diversions,  arrangements for fairs, festivals, elections  and in times of emergencies, peace  and  order  situations  would  go  a  long  way  in  keeping  the  public  properly informed. Press conferences by senior officers occasionally, and whenever situation demands is a useful method of direct interaction with the press and also indirectly with the public. The rejoinders, letters to the Editor and clarifications in a proper format would enable clarifications and action taken on grievances brought to notice. Press clippings provide useful feedback to the police officers and enable them to respond or take suitable measures. 
1. **Electronic Media:** The educative slogans may be displayed or read out through the electronic media and radio. Arrangements to make special announcements in the news channels and in cases of emergencies even by interrupting the normal programmes are an  effective  means  of  communications.  Interviews  with  senior  officers,  telecast  on specific topics or matters of interest would also help in improving the information to the public. The news releases made to the newspapers should also be conveyed through 

   the radio and television channels. The other forms of audio and visual media which can be  utilised  are  documentaries,  commercial  spots,  panel  discussions,  talks,  special announcements, specialised audience programmes, film strips, telefilms, cinema slides, video  cassettes,  news  photographs,  and  photographs  for  TV,  pictorial  albums  and record albums. 

4. **Advertising:** The main objective of advertising is to disseminate information of major schemes or  situations,  significant  achievements,  building  up  of an  image based  on performance.  It  is  also  a  method  of  presenting  the  good  news  covering  the  major achievements, which sometimes the media may not normally print or give due position or importance. This may be done in all the three media particularly in the print and the visual media. Advertising may be done through press, radio, TV and film ads, and outdoor  hoardings  and  also  through  classified  public  service  and  institutional advertisement. 
4. **Audio-Visuals:** This is an effective media to give a glimpse of the functioning of the organisation for the benefit of employees as well as others and to select audiences like visiting dignitaries, elected representatives, institutions, students and those who visit the departments and its facilities. 
4. **Exhibitions:** The trade fairs, industrial and agricultural exhibitions and rural exhibitions can be utilised for visibility campaign through erecting police stalls portraying the work being done by the department. 
4. **Traditional Media:** This media through songs, dances, drama, puppet shows and other folk forms lends itself as a very good media for communication with the public. Being live forms they have a powerful appeal if properly conceived and correctly portrayed. Apart from professionals, police officers themselves who have the necessary talent can be utilised to stage such programs. Talented teams can be prepared to tour different areas staging plays and other programmes utilising the latest sound, light and music equipment. 
4. **Other Media:** This includes open house discussions, bulletin boards, sponsorship of sports, art and culture, professional awards and scholarships etc. The sports and culture 

media is of advantage as policemen have the capacity of attractive display talents of mass  drill  and  other  specific  forms  of  martial  arts  which  have  a  relation  to  their profession.  These  shows  attract  large  gatherings  and  are  a  good  media  of communication. They also provide a feedback to the department directly. 

9. **Verbal  Communication:**  The  conferences,  meetings,  group  discussions,  seminars, meeting the public, which should be fully used and utilized for developing, should police public relations.  
9. **Meeting the public:** The grievances of the public will be known better if the officers meet the public face to face. Detailed instructions in this regard are issued in the duty profiles of the various field officers in this Manual. These meetings should take place when the officers go on tour or on inspection. The visits should be to various villages and localities. Meetings on specific subjects or on specific problems with those affected or likely to be affected should also be convened to know the correct facts and the feelings of the public apart from their views. These should not be confused with the meetings, which may be held with representatives of certain organisations to handle a particular situation or a problem. 

K   **Evaluation:**  The primary duty  of the  PR organisation  and the senior officers  is to 

evaluate the impact from time to time of the public relations function. The evaluation should be in terms of the employee's response and the extent to which knowledge, interest, acceptance and sympathy have replaced the ignorance, apathy, prejudice or hostility respectively. The results should be studied and suitable modifications made to improve the impact of the information on public relations exercise. 

**Some Specific Steps to Better Public Relations** 

464\. The expectations from the public relations organization of the police will be the same as in organisations and are briefly mentioned below:- 

1. Sharpen  staff  communication  skills  and  maintain  good  media  relations  by both receiving and transmitting information of interest to the organisation; 
1. Staff should keep the eyes and ears open to peoples' reactions; 
1. Police should act as an ambassador of the department; 
4. Police  leadership  should  create  an  all-round  understanding  of  management problems and actions; 
4. Efforts should be made to project the image to various publics; 
4. The PR wing should serve as an antenna-cum-receiver by providing feedback information and disseminating department's policies both with the employees and the public.  
4. Identify problems and measures to solve them; 
4. Serve as facilitator lubricants of communication between the department and the public; 
4. Make the management public relations conscious. 

**Do's and Dont's for Public Relations Officers**  

465\. Following are source of the things which the police PROs should do and develop in themselves. 

1. Skill in communication and full knowledge of both mass and traditional media; 
1. Intimate knowledge of the organisation to act as a source of information;  
1. Ability in voracious reading, writing, speaking and patient listening;  
1. Anticipating change and ability in understanding human environment;  
1. Organising ability and capacity to get along with people;  
1. Extrovert, team spirit, positive thinking;  
1. Good at media relations to get fair coverage;  
1. Eyes and ears to represent both the department and public as a harmoniser between the public and the department;  
1. Possess good grasp of imagination and sound judgment;  
1. Honest, sincere and hard-working. 

465\.1 The PR wing staff should avoid doing the following things. 

1. Never think public relations are 'panacea' to all police problems;  
1. Never be a panegyric;  
1. Never seek personal publicity. 

465\.2  **Liaison  with  State  Information  and  Public  Relations  Department:**   Every 

Government has a full fledged, well equipped and organized public relations network in the State headed by Commissioner for Information. The facilities, equipment and infrastructure are  meant  for  all  government  departments  including  the  police  department.  They  have representative units in every district and city and maintain constant interaction with the news media. The PR organization in the police must be in close touch with the State Information Department  and  provide  all  assistance  to  them  to  disseminate  information  regarding  the police. The public relations campaign of the department can be successfully done through cooperation  of  the  State  public  relations  wing. The  SsP/CsP  should  similarly utilize  the services, equipment, infrastructure and other facilities available with the department in their districts and cities. There should be frequent interaction between them and the police officers so that the larger infrastructure can assist the police in better communication with the public.** The Government of India has its organizations like Directorate of Field Publicity and Audio- Visual Publicity, Publications Division, Doordarshan, and All India Radio connected with the  department  of  Information  and  Broadcasting.  Ail  these  are  located  in  the  State Headquarters and also at a few other places in the state. A proper liaison is necessary with these organizations that have a responsibility for conveying information of any government organization  to  the  public.  In  fact,  the  Doordarshan  and  the  AIR  have  specific  policy priorities  to  convey  matters  of  police  interest  or  emergencies.  Even  though  these organizations have other priorities they do take up police programmes on a regular basis. Doordarshan  particularly  the  local  channel  can  have  a  specific  time  fixed  for  police programmes. It is necessary that the PR organization of the police department is in a position to produce such programmes so that the regularity and the timings can be followed without interruption.** 

**Community Policing : Concept, Application and Areas.** 

466\.  Community  Policing  like  normal  policing  is  done  in  consultation,  cooperation  and partnership with the community at large.  

466\.1 "Community Policing is both a philosophy (a way of thinking) and an organizational strategy (a way to carry out the philosophy), that allows the police and the community to work closely together in creative ways to solve the problems of crime, illicit drugs, fear of crime, physical, and social disorder neighborhood decay and the overall quality of life in the community. The philosophy rests on the belief that people deserve input into the police process,  in  exchange  for  their  participation  and  support.  It  also  rests  on  the  belief  that solutions to today's community problems demand freeing both people .and the police to explore creative and new ways to address neighborhood concerns beyond a narrow focus on individual crime incidents. 

**Principles of Community Policing.**

467\. Following are some of the principles of community policing: 

1. The basic mission of police is to prevent crime and disorder as an alternative to the repression of crime and disorder by military force and severity of legal punishment.  
1. The ability of the police to perform their duties is dependent upon public approval of police existence, actions behavior, and the ability of the police; to secure and maintain public respect.  
1. The police must secure the willing cooperation of the public in voluntary observance of the law to be able to secure and maintain public respect. 
1. The  degree  of  cooperation  of  the  public  that  can  be  secured  diminishes proportionately and the necessity for the use of physical force and compulsion in achieving police objectives. 
1. The police seek and preserve public favor, not only by catering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to the law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws; by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the society without regard to their race  or  social  standing;  by  ready  exercise  of  courtesy  and  .friendly  good humor;  and  by  ready  offering  of  individual  sacrifice  in  protecting  and preserving life.  
1. The  police  should  use  physical  force  to  the  extent  necessary  to  secure observance  of  the  law  or  to  restore  order  only  when  the  exercise  of persuasion, advice, and warning is found to be insufficient to achieve police objectives; and police should use only the minimum degree of physical force which  is  necessary  on  any  particular  occasion  for  achieving  a  police objective.  
7. The police at all times should maintain a relationship with the public. They should follow the principle that police are the public and that the public are the police. 
7. The  police  should  always  direct  their  actions  towards  their  functions  and never appear to usurp the powers of the judiciary by avenging individuals or the state, or authoritatively judging guilt or punishing the guilty. 
7. The test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.  

**Components of Community Police Relations:** 

468\. Police Community  relations  may  be viewed  as a  kind tripod  based on  three  equal components. These are:

1. Public Relations 
1. Community service 
1. Community Participation 

` `**Key Characteristics of Community Policing** 

469\. The essence of Community Policing is to minimize the gap between policemen and citizens to such an extent that the policemen become an integrated part of the community they serve.    In other words the individual policeman should know each member of the community and he should, in turn, be known by them.   That is to say there is no anonymity for either of them and there develops between them a relationship of harmony and trust.  Such a relationship is vital for the development of their abilities and initiatives to solve problems of crime and social disorder.  

1) Community policing - that it is based on a 'small scale approach.' The basic unit of 

   Community  Policing  should  be  geographically,  and  demographically,  compact enough to enable a foot-patrolman to know all and everyone within a reasonable span of time and in turn be himself known in the community. Such thorough and personal knowledge will help the policemen to take proactive measures to prevent crime and disorder in the area under his charge, both by his own efforts and by making use of the community's help and resources. The policing and security needs of a compact geographical area can be easily identified and attended to by employing local  resources.  Such  knowledge  will  also  have  its  impact  on  local  anti-social behaviour, apart from keeping the outsiders at bay. 

2) Proactive action is the second key characteristic of Community Policing. Pro-active steps will lead to the growth of co-operation and partnership in crime-prevention and security in the local area and shall earn the Community Police Officer the acceptance and trust of the community. When such bonding takes place it shall also bring the community  together  and  enhance  the  citizens'  ability  to  resolve  their  conflicts without  even  involving  the  policeman.  In  fact  such  coming  together  will  reduce conflicts to a great extent. 
2) Another  key  element  of  a  successful  Community  Policing  Project  is  localized decision making. What is to be done to prevent crime and disorder in a particular community or locality', has to be worked out, decided and implemented by the police officer serving the local area in consultation with members of the community. This will require devolution of decision making power in such matters to the Beat level Police  Officers.  In  the  absence  of  such  devolution,  when  the  Beat  Level  Police Officer is seen referring such matters to his superiors for decision, his effectiveness as a police officer will be reduced. Hence it is necessary that sufficient freedom of action and power to decide is delegated to the Beat Level Officer. 
2) One  key  to  the  success  of  any  Community  Policing  Project  is  the  ability  of  its 'sponsors' to 'sell' the project to its beneficiaries. It will be a mistake if one thinks that the community is the only beneficiary of such a project. The Community Police Officers at the beat level, who shall generally be in the ranks of Constable and Head- Constables, are as much its beneficiaries as anyone else.  

470\. **What is Community Policing and What is it not?**

1. **Community Policing is :**      
1) A philosophy based on the concept that Police Officers and private citizens' work together in a creative way to help solve contemporary community problems related to crime, fear of crime, disorder and neighbourhood decay. 
1) Developing a new relationship with law abiding people in the community, allowing them a greater say in setting local policing priorities, and involving them in efforts to improve overall quality of life in their neighbourhood. 
1) Shifting of focus of police work from handling random calls to problem, solving 
1) Putting the Beat Police Officer in face-to-face daily contact with people in the area so that the officer owns the Beat areas, develops rapport with the people and earns their trust. 
1) A situation where the police serve as a catalyst and the" people accept their share of responsibility for solving local problems related to crime, disorder and security. . 
1) Down to bottom approach where decision making is decentralised and initiatives come from the local community and the beat police officer. 
2. **Community Policing is not:**

**Object of Community Policing:**  

471\. The avowed object of Community Policing should be to minimize the gap between policemen and citizens to such an extent that the policemen become an integrated part of the community they serve and they earn the acceptance and trust, of the community, leading to spontaneous cooperation from people in crime prevention and security in the local area, and resulting in a lasting partnership between the police and the community." 

**Mission Statement: A Prerequisite of Community Policing**  

472\. A Mission Statement is reflective of the collective ideals and will of an organisation and provides  a  direction  to  the  individual  members  of  an  organisation.  It  helps  make  the 'organisational goals' their 'own'and keeps them from straying away from the 'chosen course'. It serves as some kind of a 'beacon'. Since Community Policing is a collective effort, it is necessary to have a 'mission statement'. At the same time, it is also important such 'mission statement' is something which is evolved, developed and adopted at the local level, rather than something which is imposed from the above and looks like something alien. 

**Parameters of Community Policing** 

473\. Some of the important parameters of community policing are following : 

1. **Citizen input** : Community Policing redefines the relationship between the police and the community. In a free and democratic society, citizens are supposed to have a say  in  how  they  are  governed.  Police  is  required  to  be  responsive  as  well  as accountable. Restructuring of policing priorities according to public, expectations is an  important  component.  This  also  presupposes  opening  of  channels  of communication  with  all  law-abiding  members  of  the  society  and  not  merely  the 'community  leaders',  and  using  their  goodwill  and  help  in  preventing  crime  and disorder. 
1. **Nature of Policing** : Community Policing envisages policing as a broad function and not as a narrow law enforcement or crime fighting job. The job of the police is seen as  enhancing  neighbourhood  security,  resolving  conflicts,  facilitating  victim assistance, reducing fear of crime, and addressing localised community concerns like neighbourhood decay etc. There has to be a realisation that police function cannot be reduced  to  the  narrow  confines  of  apprehending  criminals,  call  handling  and enforcing regulatory laws. The police is expected to actively intercede in respect of such  broad  functions  as  Traffic  Safety  (Education  and  awareness),  Drug  abuse, Absenteeism of children from school, domestic violence, rehabilitation of victims of crime, security of women and maintenance of order in public places and streets. \* 
1. **Personalised Service Delivery** : Community Policing emphasises quality of service, 

   citizen satisfaction, and police's responsiveness to the community. It requires greater flexibility  of  response  to  emerging  problems.  Orientation  of  personnel  to  treat citizens  as  real  people  and  not  merely  numbers  is  essential..  Attitude  of  officers heading  the  Police  needs  to  be  helpful  and  flexible  rather  than  bureaucratic  and overbearing.  It  also  requires  that  citizens  are  approached  both  individually  and collectively by the Beat Police .Officers. 

4. **Decentralised Decision making** : Community Policing requires an institutionalized internal philosophical support to promote decision making, risk taking, creativity and innovation. It empowers employees, especially frontline policemen, by giving "them the authority, and support, to make decisions. The goal is to free officers so that they become enthusiastic about the possibilities and not to get bogged down by paper work and red tape. Such empowerment will earn the policemen the trust and support of the community and make delivery of quality service possible. 
4. **Problem Solving** : Pro-active action is an important feature of Community Policing. Proactive steps taken by the police will lead  to growth of co-operation from the community and development of a partnership in crime prevention and security in the local area.  **"Problem-Solving Approach"** of the Police is an important facet of pro- active action. 
4. **Geographic Focus** :   Community Policing adopts a geographic focus to establish  

   stronger bonds  between  officers  and  neighbourhood  in  order to  increase mutual recognition,  identification,  responsibility  and  accountability.  By  its  very  name Community Policing implies an emphasis on places more than on functions.   One of 

   the key characteristics of Community Policing being that it should be based on a 

   "Small  Scale  Approach",  the  basic  unit  of  Community  Policing  should  be geographically and demographically compact.    The Beat being the smallest unit of 

   Police work and functions, the 'Beat', is at the centre of any mode for Community 

   Policing.   It is also important that Beat Patrol officers are assigned to geographical 

   beats for extended period of time instead of being shifted frequently.                                               

7. **Police Community Consultation** : Every work done by a policeman in the discharge of his duties is, directly or indirectly, a device to the community, and the- policeman cannot expect to accomplish his numerous tasks without active and positive help from the community. So, the very nature of police work is such that consultation with the community becomes a pre-requisite. Consultation with the Community can be both formal and informal. Such consultation should aim at creating an environment, which enhances public peace and ensures effective and efficient delivery of service. The Policemen must consult the community not only to find out the community's 'service needs' but also to find out the 'manner in which the community wants those services to be delivered. Such consultations should be an ongoing exchange and not an 'once in a year' affair.  It should be a process of regular dialogue and it should lead to a decision.  
8. **Community Participation** : Community participation is crucial in any programme of  community  policing.  Community  policing  is  an  invitation  to  the  people  to contribute their mite to day-to-day policing. It also means the people volunteering their time for community projects. It will also mean that people will be asked to solve problems themselves, rather than to turn to the police for formal help. Community policing is a way to remind everyone that it is a mutual partnership to help make the area a safe and attractive place to live and work. Community policing is a grass-roots effort that allows the police to build new bridges with the community.  
8. **Commitment to Community Empowerment** : Community policing's organizational strategy first demands that everyone in the police department, including both civilian and  sworn  personnel  must  investigate  ways  to  translate  the  philosophy  of  power sharing into practice. This demands making a subtle but sophisticated shift so that everyone in the department understands the need to focus on solving community problems in creative, and often ways, that can include challenging and enlightening people in the process of policing themselves. Within the community, citizens must share the rights and responsibilities implicit in identifying, prioritizing, and solving problems, as full-fledged partners with the police. 
8. **Ethics,  Legality,  Responsibility  and  Trust**  :  Community  policing  implies  some kind of a contract between the police and the citizens they serve.. This relationship is based on mutual trust and respect. It also suggests that the police can serve as a catalyst, challenging people to accept their share of responsibility for regulating and improving the overall quality of life in the community. Community policing means that citizens will be asked to handle more of their minor concerns themselves, but in exchange, this will free police to work with people on developing immediate as well as  long  term  solutions  for  community's  concerns  such  as  crime,*  drugs,  vice  and gambling*,* in ways that encourage mutual accountability and respect. 
11. **Expanding  the  Police  Mandate**:  Community  policing  adds  a  vital,  proactive element to the traditional reactive role of the police, resulting in a full spectrum of policing services. As the only agency of social control open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the police must maintain their ability to respond immediately to crises and crime incidents. Community Policing also broadens the " police role so that the police can make a greater impact on making changes, today that hold the promise of making communities safer and more attractive places to live tomorrow. 
11. **Demonstrating  the  benefits**:  The  Model  for  Community  Policing  can  work successfully only when it is owned by those who are supposed to operate it, and who are the most likely beneficiaries.  
11. **Selling, the Idea** : Policemen in India, see themselves in adversarial situation vis-à- vis citizens and as a class, are resistant to change, and unless the protagonists of Community  Policing,  manage  to  sell  them  the  idea,  it  is  apprehended  that  all Community Policing initiatives will fail. And for 'selling' the idea to them, Police Leadership must demonstrate to them the tangible benefits accruing to them. Such benefits can be in the form of people's help in their day to day work, their-raised self esteem, reduction of stress, and probably lesser work-load etc. 
11. **Grass-Roofs Creativity and Support** : Community Policing promotes  the judicious 

    use of technology, but it also rests on the belief that nothing surpasses what dedicated 

    human beings, talking and working together, can achieve. It invests trust in those 

    who are on the frontlines together on the street, relying on their combined judgment, 

    wisdom,  and  experience  to  fashion  creative  new  approaches  to  contemporary community concerns and problems, and it devise innovative solutions.                                            

15. **Internalise Change**:  Community policing must be made a fully integrated approach 

    that involves everyone in the department, with community policing officers serving as generalists who show the way to bridge the gap between the police and the people they  serve.  The  community  policing  approach  plays  a  crucial  role  internally  by providing information about the awareness of the community and its problems, and by enlisting broad based community support for the department's overall objectives.  

16. **Building  for  the  Future**:   Community  policing  provides  a  decentralized  and personalized police service to the community.  It recognizes that the police cannot impose order on the community from outside, but that people must be encouraged to think  of  the  police  as  a  crucial  resource  that  they  can  use  in  helping  to  solve contemporary  community  concerns.  It  is  not  a  tactic  to  be  applied  and  then abandoned,  but  a  new  philosophy  and  organizational  strategy  that  provides  the flexibility to meet local needs and priorities as they change over time, with an eye on the future.    

**Indian Concepts and Practices**

474\. Some of the institutional arrangements in India involving the people to buttress police work are Gram Rakshak Dais, Special Police Officers, Thikari Pehra, Village Defence Units, and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes. In the field of community policing various initiatives have been the Friends of Police in Tamil Nadu, the Community Policing Project in West Bengal, the Thana Level Committees, the Senior Citizens Scheme and unstructured system of holding periodical meetings with different interest groups in a police station. None of these schemes are institutionalized and none of these have endured the taste of time. The reasons identified for their inadequate success are lifted below: 

1. The experiments and programmes are not always tailored to community's needs. 
1. They work well in times of crisis.  Once the emergency passes, they lose momentum.  
1. The police interest flags after some time,  
1. The police often consider it a diversion from their main activities.  
1. Police  Community  relations  have  mostly  remain  urban  exercises  in  India  to  the neglect of villages,  
1. The programmes gradually get politicized.    
1. Suspicion and misunderstandings creep in after some time,  

viii.  The programmes are sometimes weighted in favour of preventing property offences.  

9. Some individual police officers make a difference.  When they go, the programme suffers.    
9. Ad-hocism characterizes community-policing efforts in India. 

**Some Concrete & Practical Examples**  

475\. Some examples of community policing in Indian contexts are following :- 

1. **Joint Patrolling Committee :** Residents of a new residential colony Chandra Shekhar Azad Nagar in the Bhilwara District (Rajasthan) have come forward to help the police in jointly patrolling the area. Patrolling is done in a structured manner and a regular roaster is maintained.** 
1. **Meira Paibi (Torch Bearers) :** The women of Manipuri Basti, Guwahati (Assam) have taken upon themselves the responsibility of improving the taw and order situations and other social problems in their Basti and tackle problems of drug-abuse by youth. The women have come together to prevent the youth, from going out of the Basti after sunset. They light their torches and go around the Basti guarding the entry and exit points.**  
1. **Preventing Employment of Miscreants :** In Pratap Nagar (Rajasthan) steps were taken to educate the community and industrialists to avoid employing miscreants. In some areas a form was introduced to procure information of each resident of a given locality. The Community was encouraged to fill up this form as a preventive measure of thefts. Similar kinds of forms were used for the new tenants in some area. The rickshaw pullers were given license and appropriate identity cards. The exercise has helped the police to clearly differentiate between resident and floating population and in turn has helped them keep check on criminals.** 
1. **Peace Committees :** Peace Committees were usually formed with initiatives of police department and were composed of some eminent citizens of the locality. In most cases department call these committees only during some communal tensions. The inability to  involve  the  right  kind  of  people  has  been  a  major  cause  of  failure  of  such- committees. Selection of right kind of people as members and empowering them is essential for effective functioning of such Committees.** 
5. **Open Grievance Redressal Forums :** Open grievance redress forums like the one, which existed in Kota (Rajasthan) and which was initiated by the then SP of the district have proved to be highly effective and beneficial for the community.**  
5. **Village Defence Party :** In Assam there is the idea of Village Defence Party (VDP). Each household is a member of the VCP and involved in night patrolling within the village. They maintain a roster explaining who will be involved in what dates. The villagers usually select a secretary who is responsible to keep regular contact with the police station.**  
5. **Gaon Burah :** In Assam in each village there is usually one Gaon Burah who is traditionally selected by the village community. The government had employed these Gaon  Burah  to  collect  village  revenues.  During  the  height  of  insurgency  police department tried to utilise them to get information regarding the militancy activities in the  village.  The  success  of  this  system  shows  that  the  traditional  mechanism  to maintain  peace  and  harmony  in  society  should  go  side  by  side  with  formal  legal initiatives.** 
5. **Friends of Police :** Friends of Police in almost all the  places are an example of who act as informers and help in prevention and detection of crime. For example, in Salem (Tamil Nadu) the youth are monitoring traffic, ensuring that the people follow traffic rules, etc.**  

**Community Policing Scenario of the State Police Organizations** 

476\.  There  are  surviving  examples  of  true  community  policing  in  the  'Panchayats'  of Manipur, 'Pacha Fayda' of Nagaland, 'Kebong' of Arunachai Pradesh and 'Village Defence Courts' in Mizoram. Formal programmes such as the 'Friends of Police' in Tamil Nadu, 'Mohalla Committees' in Maharashfra including the 'Khopade' pattern in district Bhiwandi, 'Neighbourhood Watch' in Delhi and 'People Oriented Policing' in Punjab have been some initiatives launched in this direction. Quite recently, J&K and Orissa have introduced more ambitious programmes to actively involve the community in crime prevention and order management.  Despite  initial  enthusiasm  and  enormous  public  support,  many  of  the experiments  failed  to  survive,  probably  for  want  of  institutional  support  or  individual commitment. 

**Legislation Efforts**  

477\. Not many legislation attempted have been made in the past in this direction. The most prominent and the longest surviving effort seem to be the Karnataka Village Defence Parties Act, 1964, which introduced the institution of 'Dalpathi' as the interface between the police and  the  rural  community.  Yet  another  significant  dimension  of  police-community relationship is discernible in certain institutionalized service oriented schemes started with police initiative in metropolitan cities of Delhi and Bangalore which seeks out with the help of voluntary associations, victims of social injustice to provide emergency relief as well as arrange long-term rehabilitation. Among more recent and perhaps the most systematic effort in community policing has been the promulgation of a Home Department Resolution by the Government of Orissa, providing an institutional framework to put the concept on a statutory basis. Operational since August, 1999, 'Surakhya Samiti' is the kernel of the community policing programme of the State Government which directs Superintendent of Police/Range DIGs  to  constitute  these  Samities  by  selecting  volunteers  from  specified  areas  in  the city/villages  through  Municipal  Bodies  and  Gram  Panchayats,  in  consultation  with  the magistracy. The objective is to "associate citizens with the police in solving neighbourhood problems, in enforcing the law of the land, in minimising crime, in restoring order and peace in  the  community,  in  reducing  crimes  against  women  and  weaker  sections  of  the community".

**Jammu & Kashmir**            

478\. A pilot project on community-oriented policing has been launched in Jammu city. The objective  of  the  scheme  is  to  promote  citizen  interaction  and  establish  stronger  bonds between police and the public and to involve the citizens in crime prevention and detection.   Under the scheme, Police-public squads will be set up for each sector/colony.  The public will be represented by volunteer citizens and the police by beat staff. A cluster of 10 houses will form a block and assigned to a constable.   Four such blocks will be under a Sub Inspector designated as beat police officer.  Weekly meetings will be organised between the beat officer and the volunteers and SHO/SDPO will chair meetings fortnightly. The block staff  is  expected  to  carry  out  crime  prevention  duties,  such  as  surveillance  of strangers/suspicious persons, verification of antecedents of hawkers/servants, collection of 

information regarding drug trafficking, eye-teasing etc.   

. 

**Kerala** 

479\. In 1998, "Crime Prevention Committees" were formed at the Police station level to provide a platform for the local public and the police to discuss crime problems locality-wise to control crime. Monthly meetings are held with residents' associations and the local police in Trivandrum city to devise strategies to control crime and to foster good police-public relations.  Kerala  Police  has  also  launched  a  Student  Traffic  Education  Programme.  The "Crime Stopper" facility is another form of community policing where the people can call the  police  on  a  non-metered  telephone  number  and  share  information  about  crime  and criminals without disclosing the caller's identity. 

**Maharashtra (Bombay City Police)** 

480\.  Following  communal  riots  in  Maharashtra  and  elsewhere  and  in  Mumbai  city  in December, 1982 and January 1983, Mohalla Committees were set up to provide a platform for the people of different communities and background to meet, plan and work together to solve  common  problems.  In  Bhiwandi,  the  Mohalla  Committees  turned  out  to  be  grand success in controlling communal riots. The local police have taken initiative in holding street plays on socially significant themes, organizing cleanliness drives and medical check up camps. Libraries and study rooms have also been established in some locations to promote communal  harmony.  Joint  patrolling  with  citizen  participation  in  crime  prone  areas  is another highlight. From May, 1998, an "Alert Citizens Programme" has been successfully in operation, enabling people to pass on information to the police in confidence. 

**Delhi Experiments**  

481\. The institution of Special Police Officers has acted since 80s as a bridge between the police and the public in Delhi. Introduced some time after the November 1984 anti-Sikh riots, which brought Delhi Police a lot of criticism, the SPOs have played a very useful role in controlling property offences, educating the local people in various security measures to protect their lives and properties etc. Some time back in North District of Delhi Police, very effective Nagrik Suraksha Samities were organized for communal harmony. Organising and dovetailing the Residents' Welfare Associations (RWAs), Traders' Associations, Thana Level Committees,  holding  their  periodical  meetings  with  follow  up  action,  and  giving  them various  responsibilities  for  prevention  of  crime  in  their  respective  areas,  have  become accepted features of Delhi Police. 

**Madhya Pradesh** 

482\.  For  some  time,  Madhya  Pradesh  Police  has  also  been  experimenting  on  various organisations  on  community  policing,  such  as,  Friends  of  Police  (Police  Mitra  Yojna), Village Defence Societies (Gram Raksha Samities), Neighbourhood Watch Scheme, Family Counselling Centres, Drug De-addiction Centres, Friends of Children Scheme (Bala Mitra Yojana),  Special  Police  Officers,  Traffic  Safety  Week  Programmes,  Students  Traffic Education - Programmes, Sports Programmes organised for Youth, and Career Counselling Centres.  

**C.L.G. Concepts** 

359
**Chapter **360**** 

**Human Rights and Police** 

**Introduction** 

483\. Human beings are endowed with some basic rights, privileges and prerogatives which provide them with dignity and honour. This makes their lives decent, sacred and sacrosanct. These rights, privileges and prerogatives are popularly known as human rights. Human rights are considered inalienable, sacrosanct and transcendental. They have also been accepted as being  fundamental  to  dignified  human  life,  individual  growth  and  overall  national development.  Human  rights  thus  mean  the  right  to  life,  liberty,  equality  and  dignity  as guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.  

484\. **The Concept and Classification** 

1. The concept of human rights is a compendious expression. It embraces within its fold all those rights which a human being enjoys by reason of his being human. These rights have been possessed by him since time immemorial Human rights in the course of history and international developments have come to be equated with and considered as synonymous with various types of human freedom and liberty. Human rights are owned by men, women and children of all categories for the simple reason that they are sacred and noble creations of nature. These rights are laudable and are often treated as an end to them. They are not only the gift of the State. In fact, they had existed even before the State came into being. They are thus neither created nor can be destroyed by the State is imperative for the State to recognize, protect, preserve and uphold them.  
1. Every human being is entitled to certain natural rights by virtue of his being a member of human society.  These rights are called human rights.  The supreme court while interpreting Article 21 of the Constitution of India emphasized that a human being has not only a right to live but has a fundamental right to live with dignity and it is the duty of every other human being to respect that right.  

360

3. As  a  founder  member  of  United  Nations  Organisation,  India  is  a  party  to  "the Universal  declaration  of  Human  Rights  1948".  India  also  ratified  the  two international conventions on, (a) civil and political rights and (b) economic, social and  cultural  rights.  These  Universal  Declarations  of  Rights  (1948)  were incorporated as fundamental rights in the Indian Constitution listed in Articles 14 to 

   32\. Some of the important among them are: 

1. Right to every citizen, of equality before law and equal protection of laws. 
1. Right to freedom of speech  
1. Right to assemble peacefully and without Arms.  
1. Right to form Unions.  
1. Right not to be prosecuted and convicted for any offence except for violation of law in force at the time of committing the offence. 
1. Right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself. 
1. Right  not  to  be  deprived  of  his  life  and  liberty  except  according  to  procedure established by law.  

viii.  Right not to be arrested with out informing the grounds and to be produced before a 

magistrate as early as possible but not later than 24 hours.  

9. Right to consult any one of his choice on his arrest,  
9. Right to defend himself against any allegation, and  
9. Right to seek redressal by way of writs for any of the above violations made against him. 
4. Our Criminal Justice system is based on "due process of law". Every act of the individual, Executive, Legislature or Judiciary should be with in the framework of law. Police as law enforcement authority are also part of this law.  Police in their duties to maintain law and order or in detection, investigation, prosecution of cases directly deals with the public. Powers are given to police for effective discharge of duties and not to misuse them, either for their selfish interests or to exhibit their power and vanity. There is also a misconception that results cannot be achieved unless third degree methods are used, and that it is not possible to deal with hard core criminals and suspects with in the framework of strict law. Its however,  is  not  correct.  There  is  no  conflict  between  strict  law  enforcement, relentless  pursuit  of  offenders,  punishment  of  offenders  on  one  side,  and 

362

observance of human rights on the other. The police officer should understand that he cannot take law into his own hand and he is not expected to be over anxious to achieve results with the means that is not legally allowed.   

5. Various forms of custodial violence, torture, ill treatment of women and children, fabricating false cases against innocent persons and attempts to save real culprits, lockup deaths, custodial rapes, acts of omission or commission against weaker section,  poor  and  less-privileged,  unwarranted  arrests,  unlawful  searches  and excessive use of force are some of the manifestations of human rights violations by police. The general complaint is that police officers who are to uphold the law should not and cannot themselves indulge in illegal acts. It, undermines human dignity, brutalizes the police system, forfeits the trust of people and the judiciary and above all affects the image of the police organization as a whole. It also exposes  the  police  officers  to  the  risk  of  criminal  liability  and  punishment. Custodial violence and tortures do not act as short cuts in any significant way to achieve the goals and objectives. In fact they are the tools of an unprofessional and unscientific police officer.  
5. The other practices to be strongly put down are rude and discourteous behaviour, refusal to entertain complaint, over bearing attitude, minimizing the gravity of offence, delayed or poor or biased investigation, taking sides, perverse enquiries into  complaints,  unjustified  searches  and  arrests.  Such  practices  will  assume complex dimensions if victims are women or belonging to other weaker sections. 

**Police Perspectives** 

485\. The law enforcement agencies, police being the most important of them all, are under an obligation to protect human rights. The police, in a democratic society, are expected to play the role of a benevolent defender of free people's liberties and act as a guardian of public  peace  and  human  rights.  A  democratic  state  does  not  envisage  the  police  as  an instrument of force and coercion which ultimately tends to violate human rights. In a country like India, the police are expected to play the role of a catalyst to social change aimed at the amelioration of the backward, exploited, poor and illiterate masses through the instruments of human rights. The role of police leadership in this context is required to be subjected to a serious  examination.  The  leaders  of  police,  at  various  levels,  should  reconsider  the obligations, roles, responsibilities and duties cast on them by the law of the land in this regards.  

**Police Obligation** 

486\. Commission of an offence by a person tantamount to the violation of one or another human right of an individual. Police have the primary obligation to investigate each of such cases honestly, competently and with utmost objectivity so that the wrong done to the victim with regard to the violation of his human rights is redressed as per the law of the land. While discharging this primary duty, the police should not forget that even the accused person is endowed with basic and fundamental human rights and in the discharge of their duties; they must ensure that they do not violate or make an encroachment upon his human rights. By so doing the police will be able to restore the dignity and honour of human rights and repair the loss suffered by an individual as per the due process of law. At the same time they will also save  themselves  from  being  accused  of  violating  human  rights.  The  requisite  attitudinal change and human orientation to policing, in this context, can be ensured only when police men  at  all  levels  are  made  aware  of  their  duties,  commitments,  obligations  and responsibilities in upholding and protecting human rights.  The paradoxical situation in this context is that the security forces and the police who are primarily meant to protect human rights are often accused of violating them.  

**Stop Violations: It is the Best Protection** 

487\. People in authority as well as those possessing strength, money, political power and influence try to use police as an instrument of threat, awe and intimidation to realize their parochial and selfish objectives. Police powers in India are enormous. The extent of the use and application of police discretion is also quite wide. The possibility of their misuse leading to violations of human rights is a natural sequence of the nexus between unscrupulous vested interests and corrupt policemen. This nexus leads to violations of various types of human rights of citizens. Such irregularities must be stopped.  

**Unauthorized Calling of  People by Police Must Stop** 

488\. Discretionary powers enable police to call people to police stations and outposts on some pretax or other. Calling citizens to police stations in an unauthorized manner amounts to a violation of the human rights of freedom of movement and liberty. Unwarranted and unauthorised manner of calling people to police stations and making them sit for long hours and using force, inhuman behaviour, awe, intimidation and coercion are serious violations of human dignity and honour. Methods must be devised to deter police from calling people to police stations in an unauthorized manner. Close monitoring of such cases should be done to avoid harassment to citizens leading to misbehaviour, use of force, recourse to third degree methods and commission of custodial crimes. New modes and methods of monitoring and supervisory techniques are required to be introduced and adopted for the protection of human rights. There should be a written requisition in the name of the person called to the PS, the way  it  is  done  by  the  CBI  and  other  such  agencies.  For  effective  supervision  of  such instances the following Performa should be introduced at the police station level. It should be sent to senior supervisory officers and other related officials.**

489\. The registration of an uncalled for and an unwarranted case against a citizen is a serious violation of his human rights, as it may impinge upon his dignity and honour. It also tends to restrict his liberty and freedom of movement. Various types of violation of human rights are caused by registering non-cognizable offences by giving them a colour of cognizable ones, registering civil and revenue cases by giving them a colour of criminal ones. Burking of cases, improper and inappropriate registration of cases and wrong application of sections of law and legal provisions all amount to misuse of police authority cutting across the very basis and foundation of human rights. Policing for human rights necessitates that a close and critical  scrutiny  of  cases  should  be  made  by  supervisory  leadership  to  ensure  that  no unwarranted cases are registered, that no manipulations are resorted to by the police station staff to convert a civil or revenue case into a criminal one and that bailable offences are not converted into non-bailable ones and vice-versa. A close and scientific scrutiny by senior and supervisory  officers  would  ensure  an  appropriate  action  against  a  wrongdoer.  The supervisory obligation so discharged will go a long way towards protecting human rights.  

**Arrests to be Made Only When These are Necessary and Needed** 

490\. Personal liberty and freedom of movement are the basic human rights possessed by an individual. An arrest deprives him of these rights. A decision to arrest a person therefore has serious implications. It should be exercised with due caution and care. An analysis of arrest made by police would indicate that these are often made on mere suspicion, in a routine manner and even with ulterior motives and vengeance. Unwarranted, arbitrary and illegal arrests, unauthorized detentions and not presenting the arrested persons before a magistrate as per the law of the land, use of handcuffs and parading the arrested people through streets and public places are some serious types of violation of human rights committed by police in India. This of course is done through he instrument and power of arrest. The people arrested are not communicated the grounds of their arrest. They are also not allowed to obtain the assistance of an advocate. Investigations are not conducted fairly and impartially. Instead of making use of scientific aids to investigation and techniques of interrogation, people are   subjected to third degree methods for obtaining confessions and collecting evidence against them. The junior-subordinate police functionaries in the field should be sensitized to this aspect of police power and it should be impressed upon them that the right to arrest a person is exercised only when it is absolutely necessary for a proper investigation of the case, in public interest or for ensuring social security. Policing for human rights necessitates that some adequate method and relational should be developed and adopted at the police station level  to  reduce  the  number  of  arrests.  Senior  police  leaders  should  discharge  their supervisory  obligation  to  ensure  that  unnecessary  arrests  are  not  made  and  the  legal provisions  are  adhered  to.  For  monitoring  arrests  the  following  Performa  should  be introduced at the PS level.  

**Performa for Monitoring of Arrests**

**Undue Searches and Seizures Should be Avoided** 

491\. Personal and house searches and seizure of property and documents when done in an arbitrary and unjustified manner cause serious violations of human rights. Therefore police are under an obligation to conduct searches and make seizures after a careful assessment of their use and utility in each case. House searches without obtaining warrants from competent courts must be avoided. Sometimes houses are actually searched but no search memos are prepared. This is a serious violation of law and a very serious encroachment on the human rights of the people. Investigational relevance and evidentiary utility of each search should be made more then clear by the investigating officer and it should be duly monitored by his senior supervisory officer. This method of policing will reduce the instances of violation of human  rights  in  a  substantial  way,  and  it  will  also  improve  the  quality  and  value  of investigations and their evidentiary status.  

**Unfair Investigations and Delayed Trials.** 

492\. Cases of padding, fabricating and concocting evidence against innocent persons, wrong arrests,  not  presented.  The  accused  before  a  magistrate  within  24  hrs  of  the  arrest, unreasonable  and  unnecessary  remands  in  judicial  and  police  custody  etc  are  serious violations of human rights. It should be ensured that such irregularities at pre-investigation, investigation and post-investigation stages are stopped. People should not be denied fair pre- trial,  trial  and  post-trial  opportunities.  Protection  of  human  rights  presupposes  that investigations are conducted in a fair and judicious manner and that police and prosecution 

agencies function without any vengeance, prejudice and preconceived notions.  

**Bail and not Jail**  

493\. Whenever a person is arrested, detained or some restriction and restraint is imposed on his personal liberty, he has a right to be considered for bail. If it is a bailable offence, bail is a matter of right, and if the offence is of a non-bailable nature, bail becomes a matter of discretion. But the process of releasing people on bail adopted by police is often not fair and proper. Even in bailable cases, people are denied the right to be released on bail and in non- bailable ones hindrances of varied sorts are created in the way of the accused trying to obtain bail as per the due process of law. Protection of human rights by police requires that they should not be very liberal in making arrests. Persons arrested for bailable offences should be immediately released on bail. For non-bailable offences police discretion should be exercised in accordance with established principles. Police may follow the practice adopted by the CBI in this context. The CBI quite often releases people on bail whereas the police arrest them.  

**Prevent Crimes: It Protection of Human Rights** 

494\. Prevention of crime is one of the major obligations of police. If crimes are prevented in time, the human rights of the people in general will be protected actually and factually. It is so because the commission of an offence amounts to the violation of one or the other human right of an individual. If the police are able to prevent crime efficiently, their problems in the context of protection of human rights will reduce substantially. Not only that, their image will improve and the popular estimation of their performance will pass through a positive transformation. Prevention is better than cure. A stitch in time saves nine and the crime prevented is best investigated are some of the popular dictums signifying the importance of crime prevention and its relevance with reference to the obligation of police leadership in the protection of human rights.  That crimes should and can be prevented is the basic premise on which each society legislates some provision or other for preventing crimes. By making an effective  use  of  the  provisions  the  police  officials  at  various  levels,  inter  alia,  will  be discharging their obligation of protecting human rights in a gainful and meaningful manner.  

**Investigate Crime Competently** 

495\. Prevention of crime is the real protection of human rights in as much as the probable, possible and potential violations are prevented and the dignity and honour of the persons in question is preserved. Every offence, inter alia, it is violation of human rights; therefore investigation of the crime in question done impartially, competently and scientifically works as a compensatory measures for protecting human rights. The dishonour, loss and violation of a specific human right of an individual will be compensated, if the offender is brought to book  after  taking  recourse  to  the  due  process  of  law.  The  crimes,  therefore,  should  be investigated, promptly, properly and without any delay. Justice delayed is justice denied, and delay defeats equity are the principles which should guide the police functionaries in the matter.  By  investigating  cases  completely,  quickly  and  impartially  the  police  provide immediate relief.  

**Police Behaviour to be Human** 

496\.  Inhuman  behaviour,  inefficiency,  corruption,  ulterior  motives,  arrogance,  undue political, administrative and social influences are some of the factors responsible for the violation of human rights by police. In order to render police conduct and behaviour human, kind,  compassionate  and  empathetic  following  oath  should  be  implemented  by  each policeman. Police leadership at various levels must ensure that the oath is followed in letter and spirit and the violators are taken to task so as to set an example to others. 

1. I will not abuse anyone. 
1. I will not misbehave with people 
1. I will denounce, discourage and shun the use of third degree methods. 
1. I will not be inhuman, cruel and arrogant to the people coming in my contact. 
1. I will not misuse my power and position 
1. I will neither commit custodial crimes nor would directly or indirectly become a party to such crimes. 
1. I will become a worthy member of the citizen police of a democratic and free society by being kind and helpful to the people in need and distress. 

496\.1  Behavioural  modification  is  continuous  process.  Its  pursuance  and  monitoring  is required to be done on a day to day basis. The role and obligation of police leaders in this context is very important. They must ensure that the prescribed patterns of human behaviour are strictly followed and the defaulting members are dealt with adequately. Police leaders should also generate a climate against criminalization of police. Behavioural reforms and attitudinal changes both at individual and departmental levels can go a long way to stopping violations  of  human  rights  by  police.  By  being  professionally  competent,  behaviorally courageous and morally strong, the police can set an example of their acceptance by people. 496.2  Police  leadership  at  the  apex  level  must  ensure  that  specialized  course;  in  group dynamics and human behaviour are made an integral part of the various training courses. Such behavioural changes can also be brought about by associating the police with extra organizational,  non-situational  and  informal  police-community  programmes.  Behavioural changes like reception counters at police stations and computerization of the arrival and departure of people at police stations can be gainfully tried for protecting the human rights of the people.  

**Reasons for violation of Human Rights by Police** 

497\. Some of the reasons for violation of human rights by police can be attributed to the following:- 

1. Lack of interrogation techniques. 
1. Lack of scientific temper and professionalism. 
1. Lack of knowledge of criminal law and procedures for investigation. 
1. Unrealistic public expectation for results. 
1. Political and official pressures for quick results. 
1. Misconception that laws are not sufficient to achieve results legally. 
1. Sadistic pleasure on the part of some police officers. 

**Expectations From Police** 

498\. It is felt that much is desired from police and there is need to change their attitudes and age  old  and  conventional  methods.  Scientific  temper  in  investigation  is  required  for* acquiring  professionalism.  Police  should  get  equipped  with  sufficient  legal  knowledge during basic training and refresher courses and should learn techniques of interrogation and investigation. A well trained police officer with an aptitude to learn interrogation techniques, acquiring professionalism, taking advantage of the latest scientific aids at his command, will be in a position to protect the human rights of the citizenry. 

499\. Police officer should constantly bear it in mind that he needs the assistance of the public either to maintain law and order or to gather evidence from witnesses or in obtaining clues during investigation. He can get such co-operation from the public only when he is polite and courteous in his dealings. Even, in dealing with the accused, there is no scope for all treating  and  misbehaving  with  human.  He  should  understand  that  his  act  is  with  in  the framework of law and should not exceed legal limits in his undue anxiety to get results as this attitude will in same way or the other would end up in the violation of human rights. 

**Human Rights of Different Sections of Public**  

500\. Every police officer must be aware of the legal rights of various individuals to enable him to respect such rights, not only statutory but also to earn the good-will of the public. 

501\. **Human Rights of Victim** 

1. When a cognizable case is presented, it should be registered forth-with by the SHO, furnishing a copy free of cost.  
1. Render immediate medical aid by moving him to hospital if he is injured.  
1. Protect him from further danger if necessary.  
1. Inform the stages of investigation from time to time as a duty.  
1. Do not make the complainant go round the police station but he feels that he is being harassed more by the police than the accused.  
1. Furnish the necessary documents to victim or his legal heirs of accident cases free of cost to enable them to claim compensation in tribunals.  
1. Do not ask the complainant to go to the jurisdictional police station if they approach the wrong police station.  Register the case and transfer it.  
1. Let the complainant feel free when he represents his case and do not frighten him to give a wrong impression that police are not his friends but masters. 

502\. **Human Rights of Witnesses** 

1. Examine witnesses at their place and do not call them to police station unless it is difficult or impractical. 
1. Examine women and children at their places of residence 
1. Remember  witnesses  are  there  to  help  investigation.  Therefore  deal  with  them courteously.  
1. Child witnesses should be handled with special care.  

503\. **Human Rights of Suspects or Accused** 

1. While surveillance as prescribed in the police regulations, authorised by law and approved  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  AIR  SC  1975  page  1378,  is  permissible unnecessary intrusion into the privacy of persons is forbidden. Therefore a margin on the right lines should be drawn to avoid any interference with the right to privacy.  
2. Interrogation of suspect is a power vested with the police. But, interrogation should be with in the legal framework. Prolonged detention in the name of interrogation may amount to harassment and ultimately turn out as wrongful confinement.  
2. Searches  of  places  and  more  so  dwelling  houses  have  to  be  made  strictly  in accordance  with  procedures  laid  down  U/s  100  Cr.P.C.  Police  officer  entering dwelling houses for searches should observe decency and decorum respecting the sentiments  of  women  while  discharging  their  duty.  The  assistance  of  women constable or women witness should be taken while searching the person of a woman. Any  unlawful  search  not  only  vitiates  the  purpose  but  gives  opportunity  to  the accused to use the right of private defence.  
2. Attempts to torture accused or suspects to obtain confessions are not only an offence under Section 330 or 331 IPC but it is useless as such evidence is not admissible under law. Besides there is a danger of the suspects or accused confessing falsely in order to escape physical torture, in which case, one is likely to be misled in his investigation.  
2. No accused should be forced physically or psychologically to say any thing which is likely to be self-incriminating. Such evidence is prohibited under article 20 clause (3) of the constitution but voluntary disclosures of their own free will, while in police custody and discovery of a fact in consequence to that information is not barred under Section 27 I.E. Act.  
2. There  should  be  no  arbitrary  arrest.  All  arrests  must  strictly  conform  to  the requirements of law and procedure. Arrests need not be made just because a police officer has a power to arrest. The necessity to confine is the principle behind the law. The person to be arrested is entitled to know the grounds for arrest as per Article 22 of the Constitution and Section 50 of Cr.P.C.  
2. Every person arrested should be informed that he has right to go on bail, if it is a bailable offence and he should be informed that he may arrange for sureties (Article 

   22 of Constitution and Section 50(2} of Cr.P.C.)  

8. The  arrested person shall not be subjected to  more restraint  than is necessary to prevent his escape (Section 49 Cr.P.C.). Handcuffs should not be used with out the orders of the court.   
8. An  accused  person  arrested  shall  have  the  right  to  be  examined  by  a  medical practitioner.  (Section 54 Cr.P.C.).  
8. The arrested person shall not be detained unnecessarily for a longer period than is necessary and at any cost should be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours excluding journey time. (Section 57 Cr.P.C.)  
8. The arrested person is entitled to consult any one of his choice and it shall not be denied (Article 22 of the Constitution). 
8. The accused charged of any offence has a right to be defended by an advocate of his choice. (Section 303 Cr.P.C.).  
8. During custody, the arrested person is entitled for fair treatment and no custodial torture or ill treatment is permissible.  
8. Most of the custodial deaths take place during illegal detention. Produce the accused within 24 hours of arrest and obtain police custody from court for interrogation if necessary. This will increase the responsibility of police and minimise irresponsible custodial tortures. 

**Human Rights of Women** 

504\.  A  national  policy  for  custodial  Justice  to  women  was  recommended  by  an  expert committee on custodial Justice to women, Government of India (1983). Following are some of the important guidelines for police officers dealing with women. 

1. Women  shall  be  shown  special  treatment  wherever  they  interfere  with  the  system whether as complainants, victims, accused, witnesses or inmates of institution, giving respect for gender dignity and habitative concern for women. 
2. Separate prisons and police lockups, correctional centres and separate courts shall be set up exclusively to deal with women. 
2. Recognizing  the  children  of  custodialised  women  as  innocent,  the  State  shall conscientiously  respect  the  rights  and  privileges  of  the  children  accompanying  the women in custody. 
2. The  police,  prison,  correctional,  judicial  personnel  dealing  with  women  shall  be specially trained. 
2. Women shall be arrested only in case of absolute necessity and only between sun rise and sunset except in exceptional cases. 
2. Arrests and search of women including interrogation shall be conducted according to strict  standards  of  decency.  Women  police  officers  shall  search  women  and  escort women prisoners. 
2. Basic amenities and privacy shall be provided to women prisoners.  

**Human Rights of Juveniles** 

505\. Juvenile Justice (Care and protection of children) Act 2000 is human rights legislation and is enacted to lay down procedures while dealing with neglected and delinquent juveniles. Every police officer should be acquainted with the provisions of this Act while dealing with delinquent juveniles. The following are some of the important points relating to juveniles. 

1. When a delinquent juvenile (Juvenile in conflict with law) if arrested for committing any offence,  shall  not  be  kept  in  lockup  nor  handcuffed.  He  shall  be  released  on  bail whether the offence is bailable or non-bailable provided an undertaking is given by his parents or guardians to take care of him and for production in court. If any body does not offer surety, he shall be forwarded to observation home pending enquiry. 
1. Interrogate a juvenile delinquent with sympathy, care and caution. 
1. Question the juvenile in isolation and never be authoritative.  Be kind but firm. 
1. Whenever a statement is to be recorded from a juvenile witness keep him at ease and make him to speak the truth away from influences. 
1. Do not launch security proceedings against a juvenile.  

**The Protection of Human Rights Act 1993**  

506\. Important provisions of the Act are :- 

1. It is applicable to the whole of India. 
1. Human rights are, the rights relating to liberty, equality and dignity of the individual guaranteed by the Constitution. 

507\. **The National Human Rights Commission - Constitution** 

1. The   National   Human   Rights Commission   has been   formed   comprising   a Chairman and four members. 
1. In addition to this, the Chairperson of National Commission for Minorities and the Chairperson of National Commission for Women will also be the members of the National Human Rights Commission. 
1. The  headquarters  of  the  Commission  is  at  Delhi  and  the  Commission  (unction3 through  the  Secretary  General,  who  is  also  the  chief  executive  officer  of  the Commission, 
1. The members of the Commission will hold office for five (5) years. 

**Functions of the Commission** 

508\. The National Human rights Commission can suo-moto under take enquiries information or on a petition into the components of violation of human rights 01 abetment thereon or against officials not preventing such violation. 

2. The  Commission  can  intervene  in  any  proceeding  involving  such  violation  pending before a court. 
2. The Commission can visit any jail or any other place for retention where persons are allegedly confined. The commission can also summon any person and examine on oath. 
2. The commission can also receive any document or affidavit, petition etc. 
2. The Commission can ask for investigation by any Central or State government agency. 
6. After enquiry the Commission has the power to direct the State or Central Government to initiate prosecution. 
6. The  Commission  will  submit  an  annual  report  to  Central  Government  and  to  State Government concerned about violation of human rights that were brought to its notice. 

**State Human Rights Commission** 

509\. State Government, can constitute a State Human Rights Commission with a Chairman and four (4) members. The head quarters will be situated at a place as indicated by the State Government. The State Human Rights Commission will have the same powers as that of National  Human  Rights  Commission.  As  per  Section  36,  the  National  Human  Rights Commission does not enquire into a matter which is already pending with State Human Rights Commission. The National Human Rights Commission or the State Human Rights Commission does not enquire into any matter after the expiry of one year from the date of commission of violation. 

510\. **Police Code of Conduct for the Human Rights** 

1. Police are expected to work with in the framework of law and are not expected to take law into their own hands on the plea that the existing law is not sufficient. They cannot play that role of lawmakers and judiciary. It is for the other wings to take care on the point of sufficiency or insufficiency of law. Police are only expected to play the role of an enforcing agency. 
1. The police in establishing and enforcing law must as far as practicable, use the methods of persuasion, advice and warning. When use of force is inevitable, it must be as per the procedure and to be the bare minimum. 
1. The police officers must remember that they are also members of civilized society. 
1. They should remember that their efficiency depends upon the ready co-operation of the public. 
5. They should always be courteous and well mannered and they should be dependable, predictable and impartial. 
5. They  should  remember  their  own  limitation  and  shall  not  usurp  the  functions  of judiciary. 

**Awareness** 

511\. The human rights awareness includes awareness about the rights of the accused, victim and the rights of the general citizens. A growing awareness will reduce these violations. This is also possible by educating the law enforcing authorities. They should be trained about the rights of the citizens. Accessibility to the public and prompt response to their grievances goes a long way in protecting the human rights. Enactment of laws or making amendments in laws may help to a certain extent but what is really needed is a change in attitude and proper understanding of human rights. 

**Duties of Human Rights Cell in the Office of the DGP** 

512\. The Human Rights Cell in the Office of DGP is headed by an Officer of the rank of 
\*\
` `IGP, designated as IGP (HR/Coordination). The role and duties of this Cell should be as follows; 

1. The Human Rights Cell will act as the main link between the NHRC and the State Police agencies. 
1. All  important  cases/complaints  referred  by  the  Commission  to  the  State  Human Rights Cell wherever specifically indicated, would be got enquired into by an officer of appropriate level. Thereafter, the recommendations made by the Commission are to be  followed up  to ensure  appropriate  action against the delinquent officials  is initiated and remedial measures taken, wherever required. However, in cases where the Human Rights Cell feels that an impartial enquiry may not be possible due to extraneous considerations, then it may recommend investigation by the State CID or even the CBI. 
1. To keep a close watch on the alleged violations of Human Rights by police personnel   

   which   come   to   light through   the   newspapers, publications/other sources including complaints to different functionaries.

A copy of all such references will be sent to the Cell, to enable them to monitor timely response from the SPs. They will also ensure  follow  up  action  wherever  specific  directions  have  been  passed  by  the Commission by way of compliance. 
4. Human  Rights  Cell  to  regularly  interact  with  the  District  SsP  on  human  rights petitions/complaints  and  issue  instructions/guidelines,  so  as  to  minimize  and                   prevent violations of human rights by the police.

**Chapter **380**** 

**Protection of Weaker Sections** 

**Introduction** 

513\. Social equality, cultural harmony and economic parity, are basic requisites for peace, prosperity and progress in a society. If certain sections of the society are in possession, of the resources of varied sorts and tend to dominate critical positions and enjoy special privileges, the other sections may suffer the deprivation and get into the situation of subjugation. The society in such a situation gets divided into weak and strong social sections. Societies often get classified into weak and strong sections on irrational, illogical and unscientific grounds like  birth,  sex,  education,  marital  status.  This  type  of  paradoxical  situation  is  more pronounced in a plural, traditional, and conservative society like India. Indian society is a typical example of such a cleavage which demark various, social segments into weak and strong ones. Social distance, economic alienation, general apathy, helpless exploitation along with  eternal  bondage  of  ignorance,  disease  and  poverty  and  the  consequent  criminality generate a general sense of dislike and social apathy for the weaker sections. The aforesaid socio-economic and anthropological factors ultimately become responsible for unremitting atrocities  of  various  kinds  being  perpetrated  on  the  weaker  sections  of  the  society.  Ill- treatment, insult, harassment and exploitation of the weaker section in any society ultimately generate  a social climate where commission of atrocities on weaker sections becomes a natural phenomenon. But then a country which has adopted equality, justice and liberty as basic treats of socio-politico and economic parity cannot afford that atrocities continue to be committed on the weaker sections. Adequate and effective legislative measures have been adopted in India for ensuring prevention of atrocities on weaker sections. Weaker sections should be specially protected with the help of specified penal provisions and effective police strategies. Positive and effective police-role in the area of prevention of atrocities on the weaker sections is a vital tool for providing social security and personal protection to the affected  people.  A  positive  police  approach  and  effective  preventive  measures  and simultaneous developmental schemes can be instruments to reduce atrocities on the weaker section.

514\. **Weaker Section : Conceptualization** 

1) Weaker section of society in the Indian context would mean a group which is under-privileged and happens to be economically, educationally and politically backward  which  has  been  subjected  to  exploitation  due  to  caste,  creed  and region.  Economic  weakness  is  relevant  while  assessing  the  needs  of  people requiring  ameliorative  measures  of  pecuniary  character.  Women,  children, physically  handicapped  and  mentally  retarded  people  are  categorized  as physically weak. The Legal Aid Committee, headed by Justice V.R. Krishna Iyer,  identified  geographically  deprived,  handicapped,  villagers,  agriculture labourers,  industrial  workers,  women,  children,  harijans,  minorities  and prisoners,  as  weaker  sections.  The  untouchable,  in  the  Indian  context,  are specially  classified  as  a  weaker  section  of  the  society.  Article  46  of  the Constitution makes a reference about the term 'weaker sections' and provides for the  protection  and  promotion  of  educational  and  economic  interests  of  the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections. A section of society which is handicapped due to social, economic and political reasons may be  termed  as  a  weaker  section.  Usually  this  category  of  the  Indian  society consists  of  Scheduled  Castes  and  Scheduled  Tribes,  who  have  been  for generations being exploited on grounds of caste, birth and other such social considerations. 
1) In  a  broader  sense  the  term  'weaker  section'  may  include  physically  and socially  handicapped,  maladjusted  and  unadjusted  groups  like  juvenile delinquents, fallen women, drug addicts, beggars and mentally retarded children from the vulnerable sections of the community in rural and backward regions, tribal  areas  and  urban  slums.  The  weaker  sections  may  comprise  weak  or weaker individuals and the causes responsible for this weakness are : Sex, age, incapacity, money, education, power, birth and social esteem. However, as sex and age cannot be controlled by human endeavour, they are often not regarded as parameters of 'weakness'. 
1) A large chunk of the weaker sections normally consists of individuals, who due to birth, are deprived of reasonable opportunity and access of money, power and social esteem. Access of these situations, is generation of opportunities, so

very essential for individual security and social competition. Most of people belonging to weaker sections live below the poverty line. Politically, they are a class who suffer exploitation and miseries due to deprivations that surround them.  Conservative  social  norms  deny  them  the  basic  status  of  equality. Culturally they feel handicapped because certain roles and facilities necessary for human dignity are not made available to them. 

**Police to Prevent Atrocities on Weaker Sections** 

515\. The police-role  in  the  area  of  prevention  of atrocities towards  the  weaker  sections indicates that it is not possible to evolve specific and precise parameters for identifying any particular section of the society as Weak in absolute terms. The relative state of helplessness or defencelessness of a person or class in securing legal rights to which they are entitled under the law of the land with regard to his/her life, property and other  matters should determine his/her 'weakness' for this purpose. Those who are subjected to social injustice and suffer different forms of exploitation on account of poverty and ignorance and who due to age-old traditions, customs, and beliefs along with the interplay of vested interests are denied the basic rights and facilities should constitute the weaker sections for the problem under discussion. The police should keep in mind these parameters for identifying weaker sections in any given context, for determining their own response and for defining their preventive role with regard to atrocities on the weaker sections. 

**The Statutory Provisions** 

516\. Provisions in the Constitution like Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, guarantee protection to SC ST and other weaker and vulnerable sections. In addition, certain  acts  have  also  been  enacted  and  rules  framed  to  safeguard  the  interest  of  these sections. Police Officers should have a thorough understanding of these acts and rules for the protection of the best interests of the weaker sections.  

**The Notification** 

517\. SCs and STs have been notified vide the articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution. Scheduled areas are covered by Articles 244 and 244A. Scheduled tribes are not only listed, even  certain  portions  of the  areas  of districts  or States  are  declared as scheduled areas. Several safeguards and protections are given to the scheduled tribes in the scheduled areas. Police  in  the  scheduled  areas should be  familiar  with  the laws, notifications  protections available and the restrictions on those who do not belong to scheduled tribes, but living in scheduled areas. 

**Specific Legal Safeguards** 

518\. The Government of India have enacted two acts viz. Protection of Civil Rig-:s Act 1955 which prescribes punishment for preaching and practice of Untouchability and for enforcing any  disability  arising  there  from  and  for  matters  connected  there  with;  and  the  SC/ST (Prevented of Atrocities) Act 1989 which aims to prevent the commission of offences of atrocities against the members of SC and ST. and provides for special courts for the trial of such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such offences and for matter  connected  therewith or  incidental  thereto.

**Distinguish Factors** 

521\. **Some of the distinguishing factors of these acts are following:** 

1. Under SC/ST (POA) Act the accused should be non SC/ST person except abettors whereas under PCR Act any body can be an accused; 
1. In SC/ST (POA) Act victims can be either SC or ST whereas under PCR Act the victims can be only SCs; 
1. Under SC/ST (POA) Act some of the offences attract the provisions of IPC also in which  case  offences  can  be  charged  both  under  this  Act  as  well  as  under  IPC. However in PCR Act the offences are specifically religious or social disabilities; 
1. In SC/ST (POA) Act the offences are tribal by special courts of a level of sessions court established by the Government and special P.Ps are appointed for the purpose of  conducting  prosecutions  whereas  under  PCR  Acts  the  offences  are  tribal  by Judicial first class Magistrates; 
5. Under  SC/ST  (POA)  Act  the  offences  are  cognizable  and  non  bailable  and  non compoundable whereas under PCR Act the offences are cognizable and bailable: 
5. The investigation under this Act should be done by an officer not below the rank of DSP. The 10 should complete the investigation on top priority within 30 days and submit a report to the S.P. in view of Memorandum No.508/H1/85-4 dated 14-10- 1985 the Social Welfare Department laying down that Police should complete the investigation speedily and file charge sheet in the cases within the shortest possible time not exceeding 30 days. 
5. The cases are cognizable, non bailable, non compoundable as contemplated under Cr.P.C. Apart from this a public servant (not being SC or ST) who willfully neglects his duties required to be performed by him under this Act shall be punishable with imprisonment of a term not less than six months. 
5. Some of the offences under section 3 of the Act equally attract the provisions of corresponding sections in IPC and so a case should be registered under tne relevant provisions of both the Acts for proper investigation of cases. 

522\. **Rules Under Civil Rights Act** 

1. The rules under the Civil Rights Act provide for enquiry into incidents by the Sub-Divisional  Magistrate  and  above.  The  Bonded  Labour  System (Abolition) Act 1976, the child labour (Prohibition and Regulation Act 1986), the Forest Conservation Act 1980, Panchayats (Extension to scheduled areas) Act 1996 are some of the enactments intended for preventing exploitation of children  and  the  rights  of  the  poor.  The  responsibilities  of  the  Police  in respect of these legislation are dealt separately. It  may be  mentioned that since a large portion of the affected persons are from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes the protection available in the above Acts are applicable to them. Wherever relevant  and necessary  the  police  officers  shall  apply the provisions of these Ads as detailed above while dealing with crimes against Scheduled Tribes and the Scheduled Castes. 
1. The SC, ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules 1995 under the Act specifies the preventive  measures which have to  be taken  by  the  Police  and Executive Magistrates and non-Government organizations.

The Juvenile under this  Act  means  a  boy  or  girl  who  has  not  attained  the  age  of  18  years.  This  Act  is  a comprehensive legislation dealing with exploitation of children and treatment of children in need of care and protection and with Juveniles n conflict with law. 

530\.1 This Act is human rights legislation. The problems of increasing juvenile delinquency and child misbehavior have been a cause of concern to the society. This trend can mainly be attributed to the following ills of society. 

- The so called present day materialistic approach to life; 
- Impact of Cinemas having full of sadistic crime and lustiul sex; 
- Lack of parental care: 
- Environmental factors and economic conditions - extremes of affluence and poverty; 

530\.2 Juvenile delinquency refers to the anti - social acts of children. Such acts are either found to be a deviation from normal behaviour such as incorrigibility, disobedience, running away from home, reading obscene literature and viewing obscene or crime prone movies, or doing acts forbidden by law such as committing offences (from minor to major) from pick- pocketing to rape and murder. 

530\.3 Juvenile Justice Act deals with the above two types. The first type of juveniles is termed as neglected juveniles and second type as delinquent juveniles. A neglected juvenile falls under 5 categories - 

- A juvenile found begging; 
- A juvenile having no settled place of abode and no ostensible means of living; 
- Having parent or guardian but incapable of exercising control over the child: 
- living in a brothel or with a prostitute or visiting a place of prostitution frequently; 
- being likely to be abused or exploited for immoral purposes 

530\.4 Child welfare Committees are constituted by Government to inquire into children who need  care  and  protection.  The  board  is  presided  over  by  a  chairman  with  two  or  more members one among them being a woman compulsorily. The board is vested with powers of a first class Magistrate.

530\.6 A police officer dealing with the child in need of care and protection has to strictly follow the following procedure; 

1. When a police officer is of the opinion that a person is a child and is in need of care and protection, he shall take charge of the person for bringing him before the juvenile welfare board of the area. Every person taken charge shall be brought before the board within 24 hours excluding the journey time. If the parents do not come forward to take him in the meanwhile, he shall be kept in observation home before he is brought before 

the board but he shall never be kept in a police station or lock-up or jail. 

2. It must be noted that a child in need of care and protection is not an offender. **As** such he is not to be arrested. 
2. The board holds inquiry and examines the police officer and other witnesses produced before  it.  The  child  in  need  of  care  and  protection  or  any  one  on  his  behalf  can challenge the witnesses. If the majority members of the board are of the opinion on inquiry that he is a neglected juvenile, he will be sent to juvenile home till he ceases to be a juvenile. Instead of sending a juvenile to juvenile home the board may place the juvenile  under  the  care  of  a  parent,  guardian  of*  any  fit  person  or  any  recognized organization by imposing conditions with or without sureties for the good behaviour and well being of the juvenile.

**Other Legislations for the Children** 

533\. There are some other legislations to protect the interest of children. 

1. The Child Labour Prohibition And Regulation Act (1986) prohibits children below 14 years from employment in railway, in such other processes as beedi making, carpet weaving,  cement  manufacturing,  cloth  printing,  dyeing  and  weaving,  bagging, manufacture of matches, explosives, fire-works, mica cutting and splitting, shellac and soap manufacture, tanning, wool cleaning and building construction. In other cases where children are employed, certain precautions have to be taken in the interest of their safety and health as per section 13. Violation of provisions entails punishment of 3 months up to one year. Tie offences however are not cognizable. 
1. Section 16 empowers any person and police officer or inspectors appointed under the Act to file complaints in a competent court. 
1. Whenever violation of the Act comes to notice, the duty of the police officer should be to make  a  record  in  the  General  Diary  and  file  a  complaint  before  the  Metropolitan Magistrate or first class Magistrate who is competent to try the case.

1. The main duty of enforcing this Act is that of the inspectors appointed for this specific purpose. The police officer need not therefore undertake the  job of  going round the factories or places of work with a view to detect and prosecute the violation. 
1. The police should make thorough inquiries where they come across organized, deliberate employment of children against the provisions of this Act, and a proper FIR should be registered  under  appropriate  sections  of  IPC  and  the  Act.  The  example  of  such racketeering  is  the  middle  men  who  gather  children  and  make  them  work  taking advantage of the poverty of the parents.

**Crimes against Women**  

534\. Women have equal rights under the Constitution. Special provisions aimed at protection of women and to prevent atrocities against them have been made by various laws. Article 23 of the Constitution prohibits trafficking in women, which is recognized as a fundamental right. Trafficking in human beings covers exploitation and trading by taking advantage of the vulnerability, poverty and physical weakness of the women. The provisions in the Indian Penal Code relating to crimes against women are contained in sections 294, 304B, 354, 366, 366A, 366B, 372, 373, 374, 376, 376-A, B, C, D, 493, 494, 496, 497, 498, 498A, 509. Sections  125  to  128  of  Chapter  VIII  of  CrPC  relate  to  maintenance  of  women.  The investigation of some of these offences is covered in the relevant Chapters in this Manual. 

1. Organized  criminal  activity  is  known  to  operate  in  illicit  trafficking  subjecting  the women to untold trauma, agony and suffering. 
1. Women are subjected to physical harm, molestation, and physical and mental suffering arising  out  of  dowry  system  and  conflicts  in  the  family  due  to  various  reasons. Domestic violence against women and girls is yet another manifestation of sufferings of women. 
1. Adequate safeguards and protections are provided for the treatment of arrested women and women offenders by various laws and rules. 
1. Apart  from  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  special  legislations  also  exist.  In  the  matter  of rehabilitation, rescue and treatment, the welfare departments of the government and recognised non-governmental organizations have an important role to play. The role of the police which is complementary to these is set forth in the concerned Acts and Rules.  In  respect  of  atrocities  against  women  of  an  unorganized  nature,  the 

governmental and non-governmental agencies and also the police have a role to play. In the matter of dealing with organised crime against women particularly trafficking and serious crimes it is entirely the responsibility of the police. 

5. The norms of conduct of the police towards women whether they are offenders or in custody or come in contact on various occasions requiring police intervention are set forth and any violation attracts action against them. Police Officers of all ranks should familiarize and assimilate in spirit and letter, the various provisions of law and rules in the discharge of their duties. The training branch of the police and all the training institutions shall cover these aspects comprehensively in the induction, in-service and on-job training courses. The syllabus of induction training for all police officers should contain a module on the manners of official conduct with women.

The  police  should  collect  information relating to brothels and enter the information in part IV of the village crime history in a separate sheet. Trafficking in minor girls is a heinous crime and special attention must be paid  by  police  for  prevention  and  for  rehabilitation.  Though  there  are  several  non- governmental organisations and government departments, the police must play a supportive role in rescuing the victims from the clutches of organised crime or gangs or professional traffickers.

The  movements of the nationals and citizens of different  countries  to  other  nations  have  become  smooth,  easy  and  frequent. Consequently more and more foreigners visit India now on some reason or the other.

In view of the increasing flow of foreigners and the liberal immigration policy of Government of India, it is necessary that all Police  Officers  fully  understand  their  powers  and  obligations  with  regard  to foreigners in this important area of their work. It should, however, be noted by all police officers that while the laws should be implemented and the rules followed, it should not cause unnecessary harassment to foreigners.

Foreigners coming on visas for more than 180 days are required to register within 14 days of their arrival in India.

He  is  required  to  surrender  the Certificate of Registration immediately before his departure (Rule 15) and obtain an endorsement to that effect from the Registration Officer. Foreigners holding visas for a period exceeding 180 days should report for  registration  within  two  weeks  of  their  arrival  in  India.  Such foreigners are called Resident Foreigners. Those who stay in India for less than 180 days are called Itinerant Foreigners. Foreigners whose destination in India is a place other than the port or place of entry will, in addition, take out a Temporary Registration Certificate in Form 'B' from the Registration Officers of the port or places of arrival. They have  to  surrender  the  Temporary  Registration  Certificates  to  the Registration Officers of their destination and get themselves registered and obtain a regular Certificate of Registration. A foreigner is required to apply for extension of stay at least 15 days prior to expiry of visa. 
2) It should be noted that Residential Permit as contemplated in part 7 of Foreigners Order 1948 is not the same as Certificate of Registration under Rule 6 of Registration of Foreigners Rules 1939. Registration is not required if the stay is for less than 180 days but permit is required. Certain categories are exempted from Registration as per Registration of Foreigners. (Exemption) Order 1957.

A copy of this form will also be sent direct to the Registration Officer concerned on the same day. If within 14 days of the receipt of the duplicate of Form 'B' the foreigner mentioned therein does not report to the Registration Officer, the latter will inform the Officer who issued the temporary certificate and institute enquiries to ascertain the whereabouts of the foreigner. 
2) In  respect  of  foreigners  holding  visas  for  more  than  180  days,  Registration Officers should see that such a foreigner who has been in India for more than 30 days should get himself registered wherever he happens to be at that time. This will be possible, as, in addition to the stamp on his passport the hotel arrival report  (Form-C)  will  show  the  date  of  the  foreigner's  arrival  in  India.  The Registration Officer concerned should carefully check the hotel arrival reports received by him daily to see that a foreigner who has been in India for more than 30 days has been duly registered. 
2) The registration staff at the ports or places of entry should send every day list of all foreigners whose destination is the port or place of entry, to the Registration Officer of the port or place if his headquarters is the town in which the port or place of entry is situated.

The entry of such persons may be regulated as follows: 
1. In the case of passengers not leaving the precincts of the aerodrome, irrespective of the fact whether they arrive by one flight and depart by the same flight or arrive by one flight and depart by another (of the same or of a different airline), they may be allowed to land without landing permits, provided there is no security objection, • and provided the air companies concerned undertake to ensure that the passengers do not leave the precincts of the aerodrome.

different airline) but leave the precincts of the aerodrome should obtain a landing permit in the form below:

563\. **Residential Permits** 

1. All  foreigners,  except  those  exempted,  entering  India  irrespective  of whether they have previously been in India or not should be required to obtain residential permits under paragraph 7 of the Foreigners order, 1948.

Residential permits will  normally  be  issued  to  diplomatic  and  consular  Officers  and  their wives and children who are in possession of diplomatic visas, with the authorized period of stay indicated by the words "on Government duty" (or, in the case of member of their family" "While husband" "father, etc. etc. remains on Government duty").

564\. **Extension of Stay** 

1) The Commissioner of Police, and all Collectors, who have been appointed 'Civil Authorities'  under  the  Foreigners  Order,  1948,  are  authorized  to  exercise,  in respect of the following classes of persons the powers conferred on the State Government by paragraph 7 of the Foreigners Order to extend the period specified in a permit granted under that paragraph.

1. foreigners who have come to India on short visits of less than one year, for a period not exceeding two months. 
2) The grant of extension of stay in cases mentioned above should be subject to the following conditions: 
1. They entered India lawfully and for the purpose of the business at present pursued or for a cognate or authorized purpose. This excludes diplomats, consuls or their staff who entered in their official capacity and on termination of employment have remained in India. 
1. That they have not come to adverse notice. Prosecution for breach of registration or other formalities and violation of such formalities will constitute 'adverse' notice although minor breaches may be ignored in suitable cases. 
1. That they have bonafide or settled business of work in India and, in case of missionaries, necessary guarantee for their good behaviour and maintenance has been furnished. 
3) The Civil Authorities should refer to the Government all doubtful cases, i.e., where the individual concerned is definitely, due to adverse notice or otherwise not eligible for further stay. The Civil Authorities should also submit a return in triplicate, in the form prescribed by the Government of India, on the 1st and 15th of each month of all applications for extension of stay in India disposed of by  them  during  the  preceding  fortnight.  These  returns  should  reach  the Government not later than 5th and 20th of each month. 
3) While granting extension of stay in India or forwarding applications of foreigners for  extension  of  stay  in  India  to  the  Government,  it  should  be  ensured  that passports  or  other  recognized  travel  documents  are  valid  for  sufficiently  long periods. The passports should be valid for at least 60 days beyond the date up to which  extension  is  applied  for.  Should  a  foreigner  be  not  in  possession  of  a passport valid for this period, he should, as an interim measure, be granted an extension of stay for a period of 60 days less than the expiry of his passport. Further extension should be granted only when he gets his passport renewed or obtains a new passport. In no case should passports of foreigners be taken away from them for the purpose of mainly checking their validity. 

**"No Objection to Return to India" Endorsements** 

1) The Commissioner of Police, and all Collectors, who have been appointed Civil Authorities  under the Foreigners Order, 1948, are  authorized  to grant without reference to the Government "No Objection to return to India" endorsements to foreigners falling within the following categories subject to their satisfying the requisite conditions.

1. missionaries from Commonwealth countries (other than South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) and the Republic of Ireland, who fulfill conditions of five years residence in India. 
2) Civil Authorities should refer to the Government all doubtful cases where the individual concerned has come to adverse notice or is not otherwise eligible for the grant of a 'No objection to return to India' endorsement. They should also give intimation  to  the  Home  Department  Government  of  the  State  Govt.  of  each endorsement granted by them. 
2) To prevent a suspect foreigner obtaining a "No Objection" endorsement, the Civil Authorities should maintain a close liaison with the local or State Intelligence. 
2) The  fee  for  the  grant  of  a  'No  objection  to  return  to  India'  endorsement  as prescribed may be obtained in postage stamps and cancelled. Commonwealth missionaries are exempt from paying fees for the endorsement. 

565\. **Arrest of Foreigners**  

1. When foreign nationals are arrested on major criminal or civil charges, it is possible that the Foreign Diplomatic/Consular Missions in India may wish to assist the nationals of their countries in regard to their defence before a court of law and/or take such other action, as they may deem appropriate in accordance with diplomatic practice. Therefore as soon as a foreign national (including Pakistan national) is arrested in a major crime, the fact, with a brief description of the offence should be brought to the notice of the Ministry of External Affairs through the State Government by the DGP/CP concerned. Government of India, who decides about the necessary action, should bring these cases to the notice of the Foreign Diplomatic/Consular  missions  concerned.  The  report  of  the  arrest  of  a foreign national in a major crime, together with a brief description of the offence, should be communicated to the Director General of Police, Addl. DGP, CID and Addl. DGP Intelligence and Security. 
2. Arrests of foreign Government officials in India, while they are on duty or on leave or otherwise, regardless of the nature of the crime committed by them, should be intimated to the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, through the State Government, with full particulars, e.g. name and  designation  of  the  officer  arrested,  circumstances  under  which  the arrest was made and charges against him. Information regarding the arrest of  Foreigner  who  is  not  registered  in  this  State  will  be  passed  on immediately to the Registration Officer in whose jurisdiction the foreigner has his registered address under intimation to the Provincial Registration Officer  to  enable  Registration  Officer  with  whom  the  foreigner  is registered to maintain a check on the movements of the foreigner. 

**Prosecutions** 

566\. The orders of the Government should be obtained before prosecution is launched against foreigners for a breach of the provisions of the Registration of Foreigners Act and Rules, 1939. In view of section 8 of the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939 the fact that a foreigner, who may have entered India in contravention of the Passport Rules 1950, has been registered, does not affect his liability to be proceeded against under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920. 

567\. **Proof of Identity of Foreigners** 

1. The  particular  attention  of  all  officers  is  drawn  to  the  following instructions regarding the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, and the rules under the Foreigners Act, 1946. 
1. **Burden of proof:** Under section 4 of the Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939, and section 9 of the Foreigners Act 1946, the burden of proving that 

   a person suspected of being a foreigner is not a foreigner lies upon that person, Rules 8 and 9 of the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939, gives power to officers of and above the rank of Head Constable to demand the production  of  a  passport  and  other  proof  of  identity  and  to  inspect Certificates of Registration. The account given by a foreigner should be tested as far as possible and not be accepted too readily. 

3. **Acceptance  of passports:**  A  passport issued not  more  than  five years before the date of production should normally be accepted as sufficient proof of identity under rule 8(1) of the Registration of Foreigners Rules, 1939. A renewed passport issued more than five years previously should also be accepted, if the Registration or other officer is satisfied that it establishes the identity of the foreigner. If, however, the photograph is faded or obsolete or the passport is in any way suspicious, further proof of identity should be demanded. 

**District Police to Report the Movements of Foreigners** 

568\. The movements of foreigners, including their arrivals and departures, will be reported  to  the  District  Special  Branch  direct  by  quickest  means  by  the  SHO concerned. Upon the appearance of a foreigner, about whose identity, conduct or demeanour the SHO entertains suspicions, he should send a special report to the SP or CP with copies to ACP/SDPO. The foreigner should, under the circumstances, be kept under unobtrusive surveillance if necessary. The SP or CP should take action on such reports as instructed by the State Intelligence Department from time to time. If a foreigner is suspected of having taken part in a grave crime, the SHO or his superior should promptly inform the CID. The foreigner should not be lost sight of till orders are received on such reports. If the foreigner moves out, the SHO of the Station, whose limits he is about to enter, should be alerted by the quickest means available to expect his arrival and the SP will inform his counterpart of the district to which he moves.

**Chapter **432**** 

**Economic Offences and White Collar Crimes** 

**Introduction** 

575\. Indian economy has witnessed epochal changes, during past two decades in various spheres. Bureaucratic controls have either been dismantled or substantially reduced. Changes have also taken place in trade and exchange rate policies, foreign investment policy, tax structure, financial sector and the public sector. Even in the changed scenario, economic offences would continue to exist, in all these areas as long  as  controls  remain  and  decision  making  processes  lack  transparency.  The foreign exchange coming into the country as foreign direct investment may generate black  money  through  import  and  export  frauds  and  crimes.  Clandestine  foreign exchange routed back into the country through investment and banking channels may initiate laundering operations. Similarly most of the legal gold and silver import into the country is also being widely done by conversion of black money into hard currency  through  hawala  channels.  The  integration  of  Indian  economy  with  the global  economy  may  spin  global  crimes.  The  flow  of  money  from  international narcoracketeering, illegal arms sales and funding of terrorist outfits gets laundered through various 'shells' companies. The only way in which integration with the world economy and the increasing threat of international crimes can be reconciled is by formulating increased international co-operation and strict enforcement of existing enactments.  

**Economic Offences and White Collar Crimes : Conceptualization** 

576\. A Crime, with sole objective to accumulate money, wealth or illicit profit, at the  cost  of  others  by  exploiting  the  loopholes  in  the  system,  by  misusing  the opportunities extended by the** State   to   its   citizens   for   their   economic   prosperity, in   violation   of** established regulations and fiscal laws can be broadly categorised  as  Economic  Offences.  Such  crimes  have  the  potential  of  damaging socio-economic  fabric  of  the  society,  crippling  the  democratic  development  and derailing the industrial progress of the country.  

432

An economic offence may appear victimless on the face of it but in fact it vicitimises the whole society. These crimes are also popularly known as 'White Collar Crimes' by  virtue  of  the  fact  that  perpetrator  of  such  crimes  are  normally  persons  of responsibility, holding high offices and in the course of their occupation, either they themselves commit the crime or facilitate the perpetration of crime by others.  

576\.1 White-collar crime is a Crime committed by a person of responsibility and high social status in the course of occupation. White Collar/Economic Crimes cover   offences of   cheating   or    fraud, criminal misappropriation and embezzlement, criminal breach of trust, even corruption   and   counterfeiting   etc. With   the   economic liberalization and as a result of revolution in the fields of communication and technology, many more new type of crimes ranging from misappropriation of money raised as equity capital by companies or as deposits by Non-Banking Finance Companies, money laundering from simple frauds to floating fictitious companies, making false representations to the public for raising money by way of public issues, fraudulent manipulations of banking transactions with clever attempt to exploit the loopholes, over invoicing. of-exports with an objective of claiming various export related benefits, encashment of cheques/drafts, through fictitious Bank accounts are adding  to  the  rising  number  of  economic  crimes.  The  economic  offences  have assumed the proportions of **trans-border/International crimes** committed in a pre- planned and well-organised manner by a syndicate of ill meaning, well educated and well  connected  criminals.  Such  criminals  operate  in  a  way  as  if  they  are  in  a borderless world, while the Law Enforcers of a country are confined to operate within the borders of their country. It gives a distinct advantage to the Economic offenders to take the country's economy to ransom, yet remain beyond the arms of Law.**  

**Corporate and Bank Frauds** 

577\. Corporate frauds have emerged as a major economic offence in recent times. This term includes a large number of activities such as frauds by business people against each other, against investors, consumers, tax authorities, by directors and employees against their companies. Different forms and modus operandi are adopted.    The broad categories are embezzlement by employees, management frauds, investment scams and customer frauds. Stock market frauds include sale of forged share certificates, cheating 

434

by sub-brokers, theft of securities from share registries or theft while in transit. The range of bank frauds is also quite wide and covers fraud prone areas in the banking system like loans, advances, remittances and foreign exchange transactions. The use of plastic money has also generated offences of credit and cheque fraud. Technological developments have propelled some of the old crimes into new shape.

579\. **Major Areas of Economic Offences** 

1) **Public Servant orientation:** Economic Offences and public servants are closely 

interlinked. It will not be an exaggeration to say that most economic offences can not  be  committed  without  the  active  connivance  of  the  Public  Servant.  The unscrupulous  among  the  entrepreneurs  make  the  unscrupulous  among  the  public servants their partners in crime.**  

2) **Import/Export Frauds :** Involvement of Public Servants is found in issuance of licence  to  fictitious  and  nonexistent  parties,  acceptance  of  faulty  letters  of undertaking furnished by the party, and in extending the validity of the licence. These days  recourse  is  taken  by  unscrupulous  operators  to  the  value  based  advance licensing  scheme  (VABAL),  to  under-invoice  the  exports  in  money  laundering operations,  many  a  time  only  junk  is  exported,  paid  for  by  the  exporter  through hawala and duty free import licences are obtained. This has become one of the most favoured  routes  of  money-laundering  by  black-marketers  and  those  who  have unaccounted wealth.  
2) **Forgery  in  Travel  Documents  :**  Serious/widespread  Passport  Act  offences including those involving job-racketeering are on the increase.  Passport rackets also have  clear  security  implications  as  they  are  required  primarily  by  trans-bordei criminals, smugglers and drug traffickers. The usual modus operandi in such cases is following:-** 
1) Photo-substitution 
1) Page substitution and fake booklets 
1) Fake endorsement of arrivals/departure stamps, of children and alteration in respect of entries etc. 
1) Obtain passports based on false/suppressed information. 
1) Fake/forged visas and Haj permits etc. 

579\.1  Involvement  of  public  servant  of  the  Regional  Passport  Offices  and  Local Police  officials  is  often  found  in  these  cases.   Loopholes  can  be  plugged  by introducing  features  in  the  passport  and  visas  which  would  make  their  forgery difficult e.g machine readable passports and visas, distinctive watermark, complicated printing technique, permanent inscription of biographical data, high quality of inked (wet and embossed (dry) seals and advance passenger information systems. 

4) **Bank Frauds :** Bank have evolved detailed systems/procedures/rules, inter alia, taking into account the instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India from time to time on the various areas of their operations. If such rules/norms/procedures, as laid down, are strictly adhered to, the chances of malpractice's can be well avoided/restricted to great extent. An analysis of the fraud cases reported by banks to the Reserve Bank however, broadly indicates that frauds perpetrated on banks could be classified into the following :-** 
1) Misappropriation  of  cash  tendered  by  the  bank's  constituents  and misappropriation of cash in remittances. 
1) Withdrawals from deposit accounts through forged instruments. 
1) Fraudulent encashment of negotiable instruments by opening an account in fake/fictitious name. 
1) Misappropriation through manipulation of books of accounts.  
1) Perpetration of frauds through clearing transactions. 
6) Misutilisation/over stepping of lending/discretionary power, non-observance  of  prescribed  norms/procedures  in  credit dispensation etc. 
6) Opening/issue of letters of credit, bank guarantees, co-acceptance of bills without proper consideration and' 

(viii)  Frauds  in  foreign  exchange  transactions,  mainly  through  non-adherence  to 

Exchange Control Manual Provisions. 

5) **Insurance Frauds :** Broadly  Insurance  frauds  are  of  two  types  viz  within  the Insurance industry and outside the industry. Under the first category frauds occur with the  definite  connivance  of  public  servants  e.g.  granting  insurance  cover  without booking (accepting) the premium and until claim is made by party, providing after- accident/loss insurance cover, allowing inflated claim, not taking over an accounting the salvage and other recoveries to reduce the loss to the company entertaining a totally fictitious claim etc. Examples of frauds under the second category are endless and the following examples are only illustrative :-** 
1) deliberately setting fire to the insured article/factory/godown when the market is low; 
1) making repeated claims on the basis of same accident. 
1) making claims based on false repair bills/invoices without conducting any repairs or without purchasing parts; 
1) utilizing bogus lorry receipts as proof of goods sent and making claim of non- delivery ; 
1) scuttling vessels where value of cargo is disproportionately higher than the value of the ship etc. 
6) **Corporate Frauds, Embezzlements and Scams :** Corporate frauds have emerged as a major economic offence in recent times. This term includes a large number of 

activities such as frauds by business people against each other, against investors, consumers, tax authorities, by directors and employees against their companies. Different  forms  and  modus  operandi  are  adopted.  The  broad  categories  are embezzlement by employees, management frauds, investment scams and customer frauds. Stock market frauds include sale of forged share certificates, cheating by sub-brokers, theft of securities from share registries or theft while in transit. The range of bank frauds is also quite wide and covers fraud prone areas in the banking system like loans, advances, remittances and foreign exchange transactions. The use of  plastic  money  has  also  generated  offences  of  credit  and  cheque  fraud. Technological developments have propelled some of the old crimes into new shape. For example, the developments of the multi-colour copiers whose laser scanners can reproduce exact  colour variations and  other subtle nuances  in  the  printing process  have  increased  the  forged  currency  notes  rackets.  The  direct  dialing facilities, computer aided dispatch system and fax message enable fraudsters to distance themselves geographically from their targets. 

7) **Forged Currency Notes  :** Under the Currency Department Code, forged currency notes  received  into  Treasuries  and  Banks  are  sent  to  the  Police  Station  in  the jurisdiction  of  which  the  Treasury  or  Bank  is  situated  for  enquiry.  Whenever counterfeit  currency  is  presented  or  discovered  by  the  Bank  an  offence  may  be construed to have been committed and the Police may register a case and investigate it.  The same principle should be applied and followed in cases in which a member of the public reports the appearance of forged notes direct to the police station.** In every instance,  in  addition  to  sending  a  special  report  to  the  Criminal  Investigation Department,  a  report  should  be  sent  to  the  Currency  Officer,  immediately  on  the appearance of a forged note. The report should give the following particulars.** 
1. series and number of notes 
1. value 
1. from whom and under what circumstances they were received and date of receipt 
1. designation of officer receiving the note 
1. reasons for not registering a case, if a case has not been registered, and 
1. any other particulars 
7. The note seized should be sent to the Currency Officer along with the report, except when the note is required for investigation, in which case the note should be forwarded to the Currency Officer after the investigation is over, quoting the number and date of the original report sent to him. 
1) **Methods employed for circulating counterfeit currency:** The fake currency is mixed with genuine -notes and passed on in bundles to unsuspecting but avaricious victims. The forged currency notes are passed on to the agents at a reduced value providing them with the commission as an incentive. The notes are also used in shops and establishments for the purchase of valuable items.  
1) **Method of identification:** The-forged currency notes can be identified from the paper,  colours,  and  sharpness  of  the  print,  watermark,  security  thread  and  serial numbers. The paper of the genuine notes is crisp and the print extremely sharp and of good quality and each note contains a separate number. The alignment of number is not proper on a forged note compared to a genuine note. All the counterfeit currency notes in circulation have to be pooled by the Investigation Unit of the CID and each series separated. An analysis and comparison of different series and areas of their circulation would provide a clue to the Investigating Officer. Each series should form a separate case for investigation unless the comparison of different series shows the same pattern. The IO should maintain close liaison with the Reserve Bank to know the circulation of the fake currency in question. The opinion of the expert on the type of paper used, colours, watermark and security thread mark would provide clue as to the source from where these materials were obtained. It is rare that a genuine security thread can ever be inserted in a fake currency note. It is shown more as a thin line whereas in a genuine currency note a metal wire is inserted as part of the paper on which note is printed. 

   **(viii)  Money  Laundering  :**  Money  laundering,  i.e.,  conversion  of  money  secured through illegal means into white money is the main method, which helps the economic offenders. To facilitate transfer of the proceeds of crime which include narcotics trade, smuggling of arms and explosives, hawala transactions have come to surface. The total amount of money involved due to economic crimes is considerably higher compared to the traditional crimes such as dacoities, burglaries etc. Money laundering for a layman means  conversion  of  dirty  money  into  clean  money.  The  Interpol  as  "Any  act  or attempted act to conceal or disguise the identity of illegally obtained proceeds so that they appear to have originated from legitimate sources describes it". It may also be defined as "(A) engaging directly or indirectly in a transaction which involves property by utilizing proceeds of crime, or (B) receiving, possessing, concealing, disguising, transferring, converting, disposing off within the territories of India, removing from or bringing into the territory of India the property i.e., proceeds of crime". Crime refers to several  IPC  offences  like  waging  war  against  the  Government  of  India,  murder, attempted murder, voluntarily causing hurt, kidnapping for ransom, extortion, robbery, dacoity, criminal breach of trust, cheating, forgery, counterfeit currency etc.; certain provisions  of  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1983;  NDPS  Act,  1985;  Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) and the Customs Act. 1962.   The money generated through 'crime' is liable to be confiscated by the State. The existing laws relating to confiscation of proceeds of crime are found in different statutes. Till the proposed money laundering bill is enacted, the confiscation of proceeds of crime can be taken only under these laws. The important Acts in this regard are (A) Sections 102 and 452 of CrPC; (B) The Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance, 1994 (Ordinance XXXVIII of 1994); (C) Sections 111 to 121 of the Customs Act, 1962; (D) Section 68 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985; (E) Foreign Exchange Management  Act,  1999  (Section  63);  (F)  Smugglers  and  Foreign  Exchange Manipulations (Forfeiture of Property) Act, 1976; (G) Section 20 of AP Control of Organised Crime Act 2001. The illegal currency transfers via non-banking channels are called hawala. It is an underground banking system. This  medium is used for overcoming the Government regulations on foreign exchange and also to conceal the proceeds of illegal earnings.** 

1) **The Features :** The features of money laundering are —** 
1. criminals    distance themselves    from the crime making it more difficult to prosecute them; 
1. to prevent/delay the proceeds of crime from being confiscated, if the criminal is caught; 
1. enjoy the fruits of the proceeds without being noticed; 
1. reinvest the proceeds in future criminal activity or in legitimate business; 
2) **The Stage :**  The process by which money is laundered has three stages.** 
1. Placement - Physical disposal of cash proceeds for its placement into a financial services institution. 
1. Layering - Adding complex layers of transactions 
1. Integration - Place the laundered money back into economy in such a way that it appears as normal business earnings. 
3) **The Agencies to Investigate Economic Offences :** The methods of laundering take the form of currency smuggling, real estate, gold and diamonds, shell companies, tax havens, casinos, hotels, stores, wire transfer etc.** There are various investigating agencies to deal with corporate frauds and other economic offences. The Customs and Central Excise, the Income Tax, the Directorate of Enforcement, the Securities and Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI)  are  some  of  the  agencies  authorised  under  the relevant Acts for investigation of cases. The criminal offences, which fall within the IPC as also the other cognizable offences, which the police have been, empowered to investigate, are the responsibility of the police. The investigation of these offences requires  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  procedures,  laws  and  practice  prevalent  in financial sector, taxes both direct and indirect, exchange regulations, functioning of stock'  markets,  banking,  non-banking  financial  institutions,  audit  and  accounting, computer  technology  etc.  Next  order  contains  instructions  for  guidance  for investigation of economic crimes by the police and the Investigation Units or CID.** 

   **Role of Computers  in Economic Crimes**  

   580\. The economic offences involve a multitude of transactions and entries and vast volume  of  information.  The  IO  is  advised  to  prepare  a  chart  and  load  the information in a computer system to enable analysis and comparison as also not to miss out any important aspect. If for any reason, a computer system cannot be used, this may be done manually. The Investigating Officers have to remember that a computer is on the same footing as a document and as such will prove a useful and necessary piece of evidence. The matter entered in a computer whether on magnetic media  like  hard  discs,  tapes,  floppy  discs  or  optical  media  like  compact  discs, whether audio or video, come within the meaning of a document as defined in the Indian  Evidence  Act.  In  preserving  them  as  evidence  or  producing  them  the procedure  laid  down  in  the  law  for  search,  seizure,  and  forwarding  should  be followed as in the case of any other document or material object.  

   581\. **Computer Crime** 

1) In  this  age of Information  Technology  Revolution,  computers  and  computer networks  are  now  within  the  reach  of  citizens,  businessmen  and  public authorities. Computer networks and stand alone computers, which have wide applications at home, in business, in industry and commercial establishments, in public offices, are being used for data processing and storing vital information. In other words, the information technology encompasses the entire gamut of human activity. While on one hand the computer and computer networks have opened new vistas for various segments of the society and business, they are also being used as tools by criminals who use them as other devices such as firearms, explosives etc. Since the extensive use of computers has made some areas of our life increasingly dependent on them, the need to protect these areas from  crime  has  become  extremely  important.  The  financial  system, transportation  systems,  public  records,  manufacturing  processes  and  the information  infrastructure  is  amenable  to  attack  by  cyber  criminals.  The number, economic cost and sophistication of such attacks at the hands of well- educated  criminals  will  be  increasing  in  days  to  come.  The  international communication  networks  and  omnipresent  Internet  have  erased  the  national boundaries and the computer crime is increasing becoming international both in its scope and ramifications. This poses a new challenge for the police and other law enforcement authorities that are being called upon to ensure that users of computer and  computer networks do  not  become victims of computer/cyber crime and also to take up investigation of this new generation of offences.
1) In dealing with criminal activity an also computer related crime, it is essential for the police to have the basic knowledge of computers. In the paragraphs that follow, the functions of the computers and computer networks have been briefly explained for the benefit of police officers. 
1) A computer is a machine that carries out logical instructions in a predetermined 

manner.  It  is  programmed  to  perform  certain  operations  and  store  large amount of information depending upon its capacity. The computer networks consist of number of computers connected with each other by various means and are capable of sharing and transferring information between each other. The information or data stored in a computer can be retrieved or transferred, or used in an output form in number of ways. 

4) A typical computer consists of 'input device', 'output device' 'central processing  unit' and 'memory'. The input devices are used to feed the data or instructions in a computer from the user or from another computer system. The following are some of the input devices: 
- a keyboard 
- a mouse 
- a magnetic tape drive 
- a disk derive such as floppy disk derive, CD drive, DVD drive 
- any kind of electric sensor 
- a digital camera 
- a microphone

**Narcotic Drugs Cases** 

582\. Nexus between national, international and local criminals have kicked off drug- trafficking rackets all over the country. The legal frame work is provided by the NDPS Act and the PIT-NDPS Act. Police field formations and the field officers must be conversant with provisions of the relevance Acts and must comply with them with utmost sincerity. 

**Counterfeit Currency Cases**

583\. Police have to deal with cases of counterfeit currency cases and the rackets involved. Counterfeit Indian Currency, US Dollars, The Bangladeshi Taka as well as counterfeit  stamps,  judicial  and  non-judicial  stamp  papers.  National  Saving Certificates and certificates of Examination Board are on the increase and the police should enquire themselves for dealing with cases in an efficient manner.  

**Art and Antiquity Smuggler** 

584\.  The  rich  cultural  heritage  of  our  country  is  under  a  serious  threat  due  to onslaught  unscrupulous  criminals.  The  nexus  between  local  and  international smugglers has created a congenital  ....where in  smuggling of the art.. has acted serious threat to the men existence of our rich heritage culture in . The police have an  serious role of work and vigilance to stop the trend. It has taken up a number of cases relating  to  the  smuggling  of  priceless  antique  idols,  manuscripts,  paintings  and artifacts stolen from various museums, temples, monuments and private collections. While there is no instance yet of any public servant's involvement in the act of smuggling antiquities, there is one case of a senior IAS Officer and his wife, also a public servant, who were charge sheeted by the branch of possessing an antique which was not registered or declared.  

**Impact on National Economy**  

585\. Economic Crimes or the white collar crimes cause significant damage to the economy of a country. It has the effect of eroding the confidence of the world in the financial  credibility  and  financial  stability  of  the  nation.  These  crimes  further weaken global competitiveness and making the economy unattractive to investments and effect in the infrastructural development of the country adversely. Some of the major adverse impacts of economic offences on the economy of the country can be summarized as under: 

- Marginalization  of  tax  base  due  to  parallel  economy  thriving  on  tainted money  generated  by  way  of  White  Collar  Crimes,  thus  depriving  the Government of revenue required for development work. 
- Increase of inflationary pressure due to availability of tainted money in the market in abundance. 
- (Uneven distribution of resources and creation of elitism. 
- Generation of abundant black money and Creation of parallel economy. 
- It  becomes  a  breeding  ground for  corruption  as the  booty is  shared  by  the criminal and facilitators of economic offences. 
- Illicit businesses thrive by adversely affecting licit businesses. 
- Resources of financial and commercial institutions are diverted, distorted and misappropriated making them sick and unviable. 
- Weakens moral fabric of society and commitment of citizens. 
- Poor/weak continue to be poor and at risk whereas white collar criminals continue to become richer. Countries' economic equilibrium is put at stake. 
- Making the Industry sick thus leading to unemployment. 
- Availability of tainted money in plenty also leads to increase in other criminal activities e.g. financing drug trafficking, arms smuggling etc. Money accumulated by way of white collar crimes is again used in furthering and facilitating such crimes on a larger scale which ultimately poses a threat to the socio-economic security of a country.  

**The Criminal Nexus** 

586\. Economic offences of various types such as, drug trafficking, smuggling of contraband  goods,  arms  and  ammunition,  explosives,  transfer  of  money  through Hawala etc. are **interdependent** and have close nexus by being **complementary** to each other. The tainted money generated in one type of activity is used to make investment in other criminal activities depending on the availability of demand and supply  in  a  particular  region  of  the  world.  In  fact,  of  late,  most  of  the  terrorist organisations have been indulging in drug trafficking to make millions, which are' required by them for procurement of arms, ammunitions, explosives, training of their cadres  for  subversive  activities  etc.  In  the  past,  the  Government  of  Taliban  in Afghanistan was believed to have been tacitly supporting large scale cultivation of cannabis for manufacture of charas, ganja etc. which found its ways to various parts of the world. Thus the economic offences perpetrated in one part of the world have a potential to adversely affect the economy of other parts of the world as well.

**Tackling Economic Offences** 

587\. Tackling the Economic Offences in effective way is a challenging task. All such crimes, which have attained alarming proportions with the Economic liberalization pose challenges of different kinds to the Law Enforcing Agencies, some of which may be of the following type :

![ref8]  The dividing line between the Economic offences and default / violation of ![ref1]![ref2]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.022.png)![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7] fiscal nature is at times exceptionally fine. This fineness at times leads to the perspective that unless there is a fraud, forgery and/or misrepresentation of facts,  it  does  not  exactly  fit  into  the  ingredients  of  a  criminal  offence punishable under the provisions of Indian Penal Code or other criminal Laws but needs to be dealt with only under specific Laws of civil nature e.g. misuse of telephone lines attracts a measure fine of Rs.1,000/- only under Telegraph Act whereas it may result in loss of Crores of Rupees to Telecom Department by dishonest use of such lines. 

![ref10]  To prove mens-rea or criminal intention or malafides or dishonesty / on the ![ref1]![ref2]![ref14]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]

part of white collar criminal may be difficult to establish and the criminal can  effectively  try  to  absolve  himself  of  criminal  larges  by  claiming procedural  irregularities,  lack  of  knowledge,  shifting  responsibility  on others etc. Cyber Crimes would be the challenge of the future mainly due to lack of knowledge and technical know-how to tackle such crimes, by the Investigating Agencies. 

![ref8]  As the economic offence is normally an outcome of execution of a well-![ref1]![ref2]![ref11]![ref12]![ref5]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.024.png)![ref7]

organised pre-planned collective initiative, fixing liability for a crime on an individual becomes difficult. Such infirmities more often than not benefit only  the  white  collar  criminals.  Most  of  the  offences  of  criminal  nature provide for fines, penalties/confiscation of the crime proceeds, etc. by way of  adjudication  proceedings  and  very  rarely  the  fines,  penalties  or confiscations are followed by criminal prosecution, specifically by Revenue Dept.,  whose  main  focus  is  on  generation  of  revenue  and  not  criminal prosecution  of  the offender. This mind set hardly acts as disincentive and deterrence for criminals to repeat the crime. 

![ref8]  The Public perspective of an Economic offence and a get rich quick syndrome ![ref1]![ref2]![ref14]![ref12]![ref5]![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.025.png)![ref7]of majority of the public does not rob an offender of his prestige, social status etc. e.g., an offender of Govt. Tax/Duties, a fraudster claiming higher duty  drawbacks  by  indulging  in  over  invoicing  of  exports,  an  importer diverting  funds  abroad  by  over  invoicing  of  imports  and  receiving  the 

difference in foreign accounts, a willful defaulter of banks' dues of Crores of Rupees is not looked down upon by .the society with contempt in the same way as a thief or a dacoit responsible for theft or dacoity of property of even few hundred or thousands worth of rupees. Lack of professional competence in the investigating agencies and Law enforcing agencies also acts as silent promoter  of  Economic  Crimes  by  not  creating  any  deterrence  or  fear psychosis in the minds of perpetrators of Economic crimes.   

![ref10]  Multi facet agencies dealing with regulations, enforcement and investigation ![ref1]![ref2]![ref14]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]

of various fiscal laws and lack of effective co-ordination among them with a mind set of one upmanship also ' poses a challenge in effective control of Economic crimes.  

![ref8]  The legal doctrine of establishing the involvement of the criminal in the crime ![ref1]![ref2]![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]![ref6]![ref7]

beyond all reasonable doubts also makes the task of / bringing the white collar criminal to book much onerous. Considering the nature of crime, the conduct of the criminal prior to commission of crime as well as afterwards and shifting the burden of proof on the criminal after his involvement is prima facie established by the prosecution, can go a long way in effectively tackling the crimes of Economic nature 

![ref1]  Simplifying the law relating to attachment and confiscation of property of a ![ref2]![ref3]![ref4]![ref5]![ref6]![ref7]

criminal as against existing cumbersome provisions, which make it almost impossible to effectively deprive the criminal of the crime proceeds, would reduce the incidences of Economic crimes in a significant way.

win over the witnesses or witnesses themselves losing interest in the case or fading memory due to lapse of time works to the distinct advantage of criminals. 

![ref8]  Inadmissibility of a statement made before a Police Officer by a criminal is a ![](Aspose.Words.27d6f8a3-11b9-41a6-9cc7-f9c28bccfc6a.026.png)![ref2]![ref14]![ref12]![ref5]![ref13]![ref7]major handicap in effectively tackling the 'white collar crimes' specifically 

in view of the fact that statements made before the officers dealing with administration of various fiscal laws such as Customs Act FERA/FEMA, Income Tax Act, NDPS Act, Central Excise and Salt Act etc. , the violation of which is normally the objective of Economic Crimes or the means to commit  a  financial  fraud,  are  admissible  as  evidence.  Thus,  suitable amendment in Cr.P.C is the need of the hour. 

**Aggravating Factors** 

588\.  In  India,  **the  multiplicity  of  agencies,  lack  of  co-ordination**  amongst them, **lack of faith** in each other, **lack of expertise** and commitment on the part of Law Enforcement Agencies coupled with sudden spurt in opportunities for frauds on opening up of economy, has resulted in virtual explosion in number of economic crimes.  Lack  of  permanent  centralised  data  base  of  criminals  accessible  by  all investigating agencies concerned with investigation of economic offences has made India very vulnerable for perpetration of Economic crimes of varied nature. A Finger-print data Bank of all the citizens, while issuing the citizens ID Cards (As is being contemplated by the Govt.) or while issuing election ID cards for citizens of 18 yrs of age and above, which should be connected through computer to all the districts and offices of investigating agencies all over the country. This would make the identification of the criminals very easy. 

589\. **Prevention of Economic Offences** 

1) Regular up gradation and updating of Laws commensurate with the technological changes  and  in  exceptional  cases  enactment  of  special  laws  to  deal  with emerging crimes of a special nature should receive attention of Law makers. Attempts would also be made to reduce number of agencies with overlapping jurisdiction to deal with Economic crimes as well as to set up special Courts to deal with speedy trial of Economic offences. Training of Personnel, who are required  to  detect  and  investigate  Economic  offences  as  well  as  training  of Judges, who try economic offences cases, is also essential to equip them with required expertise.
1) In containing economic offences there has been an overbearing approach for 

introduction of fresh regulations and for enactment of new /  laws  Regulations are  good  provided  they  are  religiously  implemented  and    laws  are  good provided  they  are  effectively  enforced.  Therefore  emphasis  should  be  on effective  enforcement  of  existing  laws  and  implementing  existing regulations, instead of adding to large number of legislations and regulations without any political/ bureaucratic will to enforce their implementation. As has  been  highlighted  earlier  various  innovations  have  helped  contain incidences  of  economic  crimes  in  certain  sectors  e.g.  counterfeit  proofing measures have proved very effective to prevent counterfeiting of currencies, shares  travel  documents,  etc.  Similar  measures  in  economic  operations  are likely to result in prevention of economic crimes e.g.

1. Shares  can  be  counterfeit  proofed  to  prevent  use  of  forged shares  for  transactions.  Steps  arc  being  taken  by  various- companies in this direction. 
1. The Depository System can be adopted where shares are held in trust by the depository and their trading is done only fictionally with out physical exchange / transaction in shares. It is picking up gradually with setting up of various depositories. 
1. Floating  of fictitious companies in  the  name  of non-existing persons  can  be  frustrated  by  obtaining  photographs  of  the constituent  members,  by  verifying  their  addresses,  by subjecting  the  cases  for  physical  inspections  and  obtaining introduction  of  directors  of  a  company  having  a  good  track record of certain years on the lines of system of introductions of  bank  accounts.  It  will  facilitate  tracing  of  directors  of vanishing companies and preventing incorporation of fictitious companies. 
1. Operation of Non-Banking Financial Institutions can be subjected to tighter regulations, regular monitoring, their members  made  accountable  and  by  simply  generating public awareness campaigns. RBI is already working on 

   this. 

5. Unauthorised  taking  of  deposits  should  also  be  made  a 

   cognizable offence. 

6. Discounting of cheques - It has been observed that in respect of  most  of  the  frauds  of  economic  nature,  the  funds  are siphoned off through Bank a/cs by resorting to discounting of cheques through Cheque Discounting Agents who deposit the cheques in their A/cs, withdraw the cash and return the same to the  Issuer.  Discounting  of  cheques  is  done  on  a  very  large scale.  In  Mumbai  alone,  as  per  the  market  sources,  it  is believed to be of the order of approximately Rs. 100 Crores per day. Restricting the  ;  withdrawal of cash of higher amounts from the Bank a/cs, and putting a cap on withdrawals on single occasions  by  any  party  from  the  Bank  A/c,  making  the discounting  of  cheque  per  se  or  encashment  of  A/c  payee cheques through the A/c of third parties as cognizable offence would  improve  the  situation.  Also  reporting  of  transaction  of large amounts, say in excess of Rs.50, 000/- per transaction to Income  Tax  Authorities  on  a  regular  basis,  would  reduce  the activities  of  cheque  discounting,  which  apart  from  facilitating siphoning off of Bank funds, encashment of forged drafts etc. also cause heavy loss to the State and Central Government by way of concealment of Sales Tax and Income Tax. 

**Legal Remedies**  

590\. Legally it is becoming more and more difficult to deal with economic offences as the specialisation   in commission of Economic Offences   is   on   increase   with   advancement   in   technology.   The traditional provisions of Laws to deal with such offences are often found  inadequate to bring the crimes within their ambit e.g.,  if a company which is a legal entity in itself commits a crime, attempts are required to be made  to  fix  the  liability  of  the  individual  Directors,  which,  at  times  becomes impossible considering the fact that various acts of omission or commission on the part of the company are done by assorted   employees   of   the   company   at   various   stages   under express/implied/oral instructions of the Directors, who try to absolve themselves by putting the blame on poor employees, who do not in any way gain due to the crime committed by the company, but more often than not loose their livelihood. It would be worthwhile to amend the Law to make each and every functional Director of the company liable for criminal prosecution in the eventuality of the commission of an offence by the company, even though various steps in commission of crime   may   have   been taken   knowingly or   unknowingly by other employees,    who    otherwise   do   not   have    any   interest   in   such wrongdoings. Also the requirement to prove the existence of mens-rea or criminal and dishonest intention needs to be done away  with  as  far  as  Economic  offences  are  concerned.  Once  preponderance  of probabilities and predominance of adverse circumstances indicate involvement of an individual in an Economic Crime the burden of proof should be shifted on   him   to   prove   his   innocence.   Along with   these   measures,   the legislation to provide for forfeiture of the amount together with the market rate of interest on such amount  from the date of commission of Offence, resulting in deprivation of property, irrespective of whether the victim is an individual, institution or the State, out of the properties owned by Criminal, cither in his own name, in benami names or in the names of his minor children, whether acquired out of crime proceeds of the crime under question or from other sources would definitely reduce incidence of economic offences. It will act as an effective deterrent for the white collar criminals in case the criminal has already misappropriated the proceeds and does not have any tangible assets, of which the prosecution is aware, the law should provide for a life term for such criminal unless the loss is made good by him.

**Infrastructure Development**  

591\.  To  prevent  Economic  Crimes,  it  is  also  essential  to  develop  a  sound infrastructure, which would deal with Economic Offences in systematic and logical manner.  Most  of  the  Economic  Offences  are  committed  in  very  well-organised manner and thus requires a very well-organised, systematic and professional approach to  deal  with  them.  Some  of  the steps which  can  make the  things improve can be summarised as under :-

1. Organized/Standardized  collection  and  collation  of  information  and  close monitoring of its dissemination to respective agencies. 
2. Setting  up  of  common  database  with  a  view  to  exchange  information   on regular basis. 
2. Establishment  of  proper  infrastructure  to  discharge  crime  prevention responsibilities 
2. Informal measures, such as personnel exchange and regular coordination at operational levels amongst officers of various agencies. 
2. A transparent information sharing mechanism among various agencies. 
2. Networking of all agencies through innovative technological solutions. 
2. Hosting the set-up with officers of proven integrity and competence. 

VIII.  Incentives  to  effective  enforcement  of  crime  prevention  detection  and 

recovery measures. 

IX.  As the Economic Crimes have  crossed the borders of the country and are 

committed with the help of Transnational set ups, it is absolutely essential to also evolve an institutional mechanism, which may ensure easy access to the information/records available with the member countries for each other and evolving a strategy to combat the crime. Mutual co-operation of very high order among various countries will help in effectively combating the trans- border white collar crime.   

592\. **Investigation of Economic Crimes** 

1) **Preliminary  Enquiry  :**  In  financial  crimes  the  report  generally  lists  out certain  details  with  a  request  for  investigation.  The  report  may  not  clearly disclose a cognizable offence and at the same time the information cannot also be ignored.  The  newspapers  also  publish  information  on  some  frauds.  The documents to support allegations may not be available immediately. Some of the information received may not be clear about the period and the exact offence committed but it may very often contain general information. The place of the offence in some cases is spread over a vast area. On the face of it, sometimes the information may only disclose a civil liability. In such situations it is necessary to take up a preliminary enquiry. The IOs should have the full knowledge about the way  these  crimes  are  committed  and  its  ramifications  besides  possessing minimum  knowledge  in  Computer  applications,  foreign  exchange transactions,  import  and  export,  excise  and  customs,  share  market transactions etc.
2) **Registration  of  FIR:**  A  preliminary  enquiry  into  the  information  is permissible before registering an FIR and taking up investigation. As and when the enquiry discloses a cognizable offence, it should be registered and investigated. Sometimes departmental authorities conduct enquiries and lodge a complaint for registration of a case and investigation. In such cases the facts will be clear and the case should be registered and investigation taken up. If, even such report does not disclose an offence, the authorities should be informed in writing and requested to make further enquiries or clarify and send a report. 
2) **Role of Documents :** The investigation into economic crime is mostly based on  documents  and  instruments.  The  IO  has  to  secure  all  the  relevant  files  and documents as per the procedure and processes prescribed in law. The location and tracing  of  the  documents  is  a  matter  of  utmost  importance.  In  cases  involving official agencies no time should be lost in getting hold of the connected files. The documents and &* files include those stored in computers. Presently computers of various sizes are used to store information files or notes instead of paper files or notebooks  or  in  addition  to  them.  The  courts  have  to  be  provided  with  best available evidence.
2) **Examination of Witnesses :** The examination of witnesses particularly those who are connected with the documents are the other steps that an IO has to take. A questionnaire should be prepared with reference to the records and the statements of the witnesses recorded. It will be difficult for the witnesses to deny or mislead if the documents are in possession of the Investigating authorities. 
2) **Examination of Accused :** The examination of the accused person in great detail is required to know the significance of various entries in the registers as also other documents seized if the course of investigation. As in the case of witnesses the 10 covering a-; the points that require to be elicited should prepare a detailed questionnaire. I: is if framing the questionnaire the skill of the IO is exhibited. The question should no"   be framed in such a manner that the accused comes to know the native of evidence available with the investigating authorities. As investigation in economic frauds is a lengthy process, it will be necessary to fully utilize the provisions of remand of the accused to police custody. Lie detector tests wherever necessary would be useful in such cases. 
6) **Co-operative and Coordination :** Mutual cooperation with different agencies and other institutions is extremely important in the investigation of these cases. After locating the witnesses or documents it would be very necessary to enlist the cooperation  of  the  concerned  authorities  in  securing  the  documents  and  the presence of the witnesses. The personnel either posted in the department or working elsewhere  who  have  the  expert  knowledge  should  be  identified  and  their  help obtained.  Mostly  the  accounts,  banking,  stock  markets,  excise  and  other  tax departments  and  chartered  accountants  would  be  useful  for  consultation  and scrutiny of documents in such cases. 
6) The most effective method of dealing with economic offences is to obtain information relating to location of the money  involved in the form of cash or bank deposits or fixed assets or in any other form and taking measures for its seizure. It will be necessary to collect evidence to link the money or the assets to the accused. It is in this area that painstaking enquiries are required. The first action to be taken on the information should be to safeguard the property or the assets movable or immovable either by having the bank account frozen or seizing the property or entrusting the property to the concerned Revenue authorities under the provisions of section 452 Cr.P.C. After this action is taken it would be necessary to collect evidence so that its forfeiture and confiscation can be done. In the event of the assets being in another jurisdiction within India the help of concerned police should be taken in the manner provided in CrPC. A 10 has powers to search and seize the property concerned in a case anywhere in the country. It is advisable however to take the assistance of the local police at a proper level. If the property or money is abroad, the investigative assistance may be requested under 166-A CrPC.  

593\. **Investigation Difficulties**  

1. The investigation of economic offences is primarily document based and involves laborious scrutiny of a large number of financial transactions spread over a vast territory. The skill of understanding, interpreting and connecting 

   documents with another have to develop in the IOs. 

2. Scientific examination of the documentary evidence is an important aspect of the investigation and opinions are delayed because of huge work-load at the GEQD and documents Division of the CFSL and the Security Printing Press and the Bank Note Press and the investigation work consequently held up. 
2. Difficulty in obtaining documents from foreign countries and the testimony of the person who has to prove the document necessitates recourse to the time- consuming process of issuing of letters rogatory and awaiting their replies. 
2. Part investigation conducted through Interpol many at time do not give any concrete results as a large number of economic offences in India are not an offense at all under the laws of many foreign countries and they are not keen to part with any information in such cases. 
2. Many a time a Govt. agency involved is not too keen to give a complaint. Complaints let apart the investigation; even a case/crime is not registered. 
2. Prosecution in most economic offences is also delayed because the trial is under complaint procedure where pre charge evidence has to be brought in u/s 244 Cr.PC only after the completion of which the charge is framed u/s 246 Cr.PC and in fact witnesses are examined and cross examined twice.  
2. Since most economic offenders are extremely rich and powerful, the legal loopholes are fully exploited and sometimes, even investigation is stayed due to courts orders.

**Chapter **457**** 

**Organized Crimes and Police** 

**Introduction** 

594\. "Organised  crime"  means any  continuing  unlawful activity by an  individual, singly or jointly, either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate, by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion, or other unlawful means, with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits, or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person, "Organised crime syndicate"  means  a  group  of  two  or  more  persons  who,  acting  either  singly  or collectively, as a syndicate or gang indulge in activities of organised crime. Organised crime  is  committed  against  property,  persons  or  human  welfare,  engineered  by  a leader with members professing fierce loyalty. Organised crime in a large measure affects law and order and public order. The terms mafia crime or mafia gangs are used in common parlance to mean organised crime and criminal gangs. The collaborative criminal activities by cohesive groupings in the underworld are known as organised crime. This has assumed menacing proportions in large cities, more particularly the metropolitan ones. These bands of criminals are continuously increasing their spheres of  activity  territorially  and  functionally.  This  has  enabled  them  to  spread  their tentacles  to  lesser  urban  conglomerates  on  the  one  hand  and  conducive  foreign countries on the other. Escalation of organised crime is global in the sense that there is immense mushrooming of organised criminal gangs all over the global landscape. Organised crime has how become truly transnational and should no longer be taken lightly as a localized minor disturbance.  

**Characteristics** 

595\. Some of the groups are so well organized that they are able to perpetrate crimes without being caught or punished. It means they must have certain code of conduct, abilities, equipment, arms, and intelligence within the group and power to have their way. Some times, they resort to elimination or threatening to the persons who come in their  way  including  witnesses,  informers,  police  officials,  lawyers  or  judge  or 

457

politicians  or  alternately  try  to  buy  their  support  by  bribery  and  collusion.  They infiltrate into political parties and use muscle power to manipulate elections and even occupy positions of political power. Therefore at the one end of spectrum there are small criminal organisations operating in a limited sphere quietly and at the other end, more  sophisticated  outfits  with  all  attributes  of  a  mafia  gang.  The  purpose  of organised crime is mainly to make illegal money. These organised groups have a complex network with well-defined structure and command and control and use force or violence in perpetration of crimes.  

**Investigation Approach** 

596\.  Investigation  into  organised  crime  therefore  calls  for  a  highly  professional approach,  intelligence  and  investigative  skills  and  well  knit  coordination  at  inter- district, inter-state and international levels. There are several laws to deal with each one of these activities. It is necessary that the IO is familiar with those provisions of law.  

**Legal Provisions** 

597\. The legal provisions relating to confiscation of proceeds of crime are contained in sections 102, 452 of CrPC, 111 to 121 of Customs Act, Section 68 of NDPS Act and  section  20  of  AP  Control  of  Organized  Crime  Act  2001.  The  Criminal  Law (Amendment Order 1944), Foreign exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA) and the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulation (Forfeiture of Property) Act 1976 also relate to forfeiture of proceeds of crime.  

**Organized Criminal Gangs**  

598\. Criminal gangs have been operating in India since ancient times. They usually preyed on travelers and wayfarers whom they waylaid while traversing lonely routes that passed through thick jungles. Occasionally they invaded villages and towns and freely  indulged  in  reckless  plunder  and  murder  of  innocent  inhabitants.  Today, however,  the  organized  criminal  gangs'  activities  have  proliferated  in  diverse directions and have become more complex and potent. Organized crime has become a nightmare for the law enforcement agencies more particularly the police who are the frontline forces when it comes to accountability to people, because there is no easy 

458

way of handling this menaces that will yield quick results.  

**The Special Features of Criminal Gangs**

599\. An extremely high degree of consensus exists among professional organized criminals, who develop common attitudes towards themselves, towards their crimes, and towards the police who are seen as common enemy. There is quite definitely a code of honour among them and highly specialized vocabulary peculiar to a group of the underworld developed and transmitted from one generation to another. They also develop a common approach to problems such as  

1. the decision as to which crime shall be committed**   
1. the geographical area of operation**  
1. the initiation of new members** 
1. how to dispose to the stolen property** 
1. how to protect a member of the gang if caught and,** 
1. securing cooperation of powerful people.**  
1. the group has a common culture, a common bond and a common code.**  

600\. **Criminal Gang and Organized Crime** 

1. An organized crime group is defined as any group having some manner of formalized structure whose primary objective is to obtain money through illegal activities and maintains it position through the use of violence or the threat of violence, corrupt public officials, graft or extortion and has an adverse effect on the people in its locale or region or the country as a whole. 
1. Organized crime as a phenomenon seeks to operate outside the control of the  people  and  their  government.  It  involves  thousands  of  criminals working within structures as complex as those of any large corporation, subject to laws of their own making more rigidly enforced than those of the  legitimate  government.  Its  actions  are  not  impulsive  but  rather  the result of intricate conspiracies carried on over years and aimed at gaining control over whole fields of activity in order to amass huge profits.  
3. The criminal group involved in organized crime as continuing structured collectivity of persons who utilize criminality, violence and a willingness to corrupt in order to gain and maintain power and profit. Any enterprise or group of persons engaged in a continuing illegal activity which has as its  primary  purpose  the  generation  of  profits  irrespective  of  national boundaries can be termed as organized crime. 
3. Organized  crime  as  an  integral  part  of  a  nation's  social  political,  and economic life and as one of the major social ills, grows with urban living. The practitioners of organized crime often are society's economically poor young people who have lost faith in the capacity of the society to work on their  behalf.  Because  of  this  perception  many  young  people  have organized  and  created  counter-cultural  structures  that  they  believe  are capable of delivering the kinds of emotional support and material goods the large society promises but does not make available to youngsters like themselves.  
3. Organized crime like any other enterprise, it supplied goods and service declared illegal by government illicit sex, illegal alcohol and drugs and usurious wares  to voluntary customers in a supply and demand model. At the same time, however, organized criminals use the proceeds from these illegal activities to finance such related crimes as hijacking, extortion, the resale  of  stolen  goods,  and  the  use  of  criminal  tactics  to  monopolize business and labour unions. The profits are also used to corrupt public officials who in turn promote and protect the criminal activities.  

**Nature of Organized Crime** 

601\. There are certain basic assumptions about the nature of organized crime.  

1. The  organized  crime  is  indeed  organized.  It  possesses  some  form  of regularized interaction, roles and structure. It differs from street crime which is more incident centered and does not involve the degree of planning or the inter-connected  network  of  legal  and  illegal  activities  which  are  a 

   characteristic of organized crime.  

2. Organized crime has goals and objectives, strategies and tactics to attain these ends and to minimize risk.  
2. Organized crime is protected, in as much as, it uses violence or the threat of violence  and  to  an  extend  depends  for  its  existence  on  some  degree  of corruption and influence in the political and enforcement sectors and  
2. Organized  crime  encompasses  a  wide  range  of  illegal  and  illicit  activities whose major purpose is to provide goods and service to an accepting public.  
2. Organized crime is a group activity 
2. It has continuity over time 
2. Organized criminal groups: 
1) ensure that they can survive the death of imprisonment of their leaders and  
1) can vary the nature of their activities to take advantage of changing criminal opportunities. 

viii.  All organized groups are headed by a single charismatic leader or a syndicate 

and is structured into a series of subordinate ranks, although they may vary in the rigidity of their hierarchy.  

9. Large  and  widespread  organiztions  may  be  composed  of  multiple  separate groups or units, each unit generally headed by its own leader who is supported by the groups hierarchy of command. 
9. Inter-group  disputes,  joint  ventures  and  new  membership  are  generally reviewed by a syndicate or Board composed of leaders of the groups. 
9. Key members are protected, insulted and buffered by forms of organization structuring and by the use of fronts and non-members associates. 
9. Members are formally accepted by the group after a demonstration of loyalty and a willingness to commit criminal acts. Membership any be limited by language,  region,  religion,  ethnicity  or  common  background  and  generally involves  a  life  time  of  commitment  to  the  group  which  can  be  enforced through violent group activities.  

xiii.  Wealth,  power  and  control  are  key  goals  of  organised  crime  and  may  be 

achieved through criminal activity of one or several types. 

14. Criminal activity may be designed directly to generate income or to support 

    the  group's  power  through  bribery,  violence,  and  intimidation.  Violence  is used to  maintain group loyalty and to intimidate outsiders, and is a threat underlying all group activity. Specific violent acts include, murder, kidnapping arson, robbery and bombings. 

15. Organized crime possesses capital for complex, long term, planned enterprises and operations. 
15. Long  term  goals  stress  the  maximization  of  profit  and  power  through  the cartelization or monopolization of criminal enterprises and markets, as well as control over legitimate business and sectors of economy. 

xvii.  Legitimate  businesses  are  used  to  launder  illegal  funds  or  stolen  goods. 

Legitimate business involvement also elevates the social status of organized crime figures.  

**Police Perspectives** 

602\. Organised crime is neither created nor sustained by the police though they may perhaps  derive  certain  benefit  both  legitimate  as  well  as  illegitimate  from  its existence. They simply have no control over the causative factors that give rise to organised crime or its growth. They can at best control and contain organised crime which exists in every large city in a lesser or greater degree. It can be justifiably said that organised crime grows with the growth of a city.  

602\.1  Neutralization  of  the  law  enforcement  machinery  is  a  vital  objective  of organised crime because only by doing so it can expand its multifarious criminal and other antisocial activities. It tries to accomplish this important objective basically by bribery.  It  tries  to  bribe  police  officers  involved  in  the  enforcement  of  laws  that hamper criminal activities of organised gangs so that they look the other way when the gangsters are engaged in their criminal trade. In the alternative or in addition they try to put pressure on the officers by bribing and in several ways obliging politicians especially those in power. This subterfuge is taken recourse to more particularly when a dutiful police officer resists their attempts to corrupt him.  

602\.2 During the course of their duties as busters of crime the police do come in contact with criminals either as suspects and accused or as informers. The total effect on  the  personality  of  a  police  officer  of  these  encounters  with  baser  elements  of society,  one  must  admit,  is  negative  which  slowly  almost  imperceptibly  in  the beginning erodes his personality. Therefore, unless he is a man of strong character and is aware of the malefic influence of the criminals he deals with; it is highly possible that he comes under their influence especially if they are affluent criminals who can offer heavy bribes and good things of life one may aspire for. With the erosion of values in the society and less of professionalism in younger police officers, it is inevitable that their resistance collapses like a domino before the high allurements held out by the organised criminals for the "small" and not easily detectable favour of not doing one's duty sincerely and diligently. Every police officer, the senior police leaders  and  supervisors  must  ward  themselves  off  these  influences  for  fighting organised crimes in an effective way.   

**Action Plan for Handling Organised Crimes** 

603\. Following action plan and strategy should be adopted for dealing with organised crimes: 

1) **Structuring and Equipping Police :** Organised crime's versatility, flexibility of operational techniques, abundant resources with the criminals, their easy access to modern  technological  innovations,  operational  ruthlessness,  ability  to  corrupt  and neutralize political, bureaucratic as well as enforcement agencies of the government and above all the obsession with money and the power etc., all make it imperative that the police entrusted with the task of grappling with it should be properly equipped to handle the situations of organised crimes.  Organised criminal gangs transgress police jurisdictional limits and even the international boundaries, therefore,  police forces must of necessity be geared to face the menace with mutual support and cooperation to one another.  
1) **Special Task Force (STF) :** A Special Task Force (STF) with whole time and sole responsibility should be constituted to tackle organised crimes.  
1) **Coordination and Cooperation :** Organized crime operates across jurisdictions of police stations, across states and even across the national boundaries, therefore, it needs to be treated as a problem of national priority. It would require a high degree of 

   intra-police force and inter-police forces coordination and cooperation.**  

4) **Comprehensive Approach :** Instead of targeting only individual gang members who have committed an offence, the entire criminal gang which has backed the effort must be targeted. The investigation should have for its objective the prosecution of gang members at all levels of its hierarchy more particularly the top leadership.**  
4) **Efficiency and Effectiveness :** Efficient and effective handling of organised crime calls for a high degree of sophistication in the techniques of investigation and sound knowledge of law and procedure. The Special task Force should have, as its main  component,  a  professional  investigating  team  comprising  experienced  police officers known for their knowledge of criminal law and procedure and a penchant for meticulously and painstakingly carrying out an investigation. They should have the necessary flair for writing, as in this kind of investigation preparation of case papers in a methodical and systematic manner is absolutely necessary. These police officers should be duly assisted by trained financial personnel like Chartered Accountants, Financial  Analysts  etc.  The  Special  Task  Force  should  have  strong  investigative ability,  in  addition  to  having  ready  availability  of  Forensic  Science  laboratory assistance and aid of photographic and technical personnel as well as handwriting experts.**  
4) **Legal Aid and Assistance :**  It is necessary to associate a prosecutor or legal advisor with the investigative wing so that from the very beginning the investigating team will have the benefit of legal advice in the light of the latest rulings of the superior  courts,  past  experiences  in  the  trial  courts  etc.   The  prosecutor  or  legal advisor should also assist the investigating officers in preparing charge sheets and choosing witnesses and evidence to be cited. What is more, when the case comes up for  hearing  he  will  be  able  to  competently  and  confidently  brief  the  special government  counsel  who  will  be  actually  conducting  the  case  or  when  bail applications come up for consideration.**  
4) **Criminal Intelligence: General Context :** Reliable, accurate, complete and timely criminal intelligence  is the basis of any sustained campaign against organised crime.  A  sound  system  need  to  be  developed,  for  collecting  strategic  as  well  as tactical intelligence. Collection of criminal intelligence is the responsibility of every policeman.  A policeman on beat or patrol duty, a traffic policeman at a fixed point, an  officer  going  to  a  crime  infested  locality  to  investigate  a  reportedly  minor complaint,  and  an  investigating  officer  interrogating  an  accused  in  a  seemingly unrelated  crime  can  all  make  useful  contribution,  if  they  are  made  aware  of  the requirement and sensitized to recognize their responsibility in the war against criminal gangs.**  
8) **Intelligence Collection by STF :**  
1) The  Special  Task  Force  should  have  a  Criminal  Intelligence  Wing.  The  wing should have the following functions:** 
1) Responsibility of this wing should be to act as store house for all reliable information on criminal gangs and gangsters. A system should be developed whereby  all  relevant  information  received  from  any  quarters  would automatically flow to it. IT should get information on gang related crimes. 
1) Information on arrested gangsters and persons suspected to be involved in some capacity in gang activities. 
1) Information on victims and property that is subject of gang crime 
1) Information  about  vehicles,  weapons,  houses,  hotels,  business  place, telephones etc. used by gangsters for their activities. 
1) Persons,  establishments,  enterprises,  who  are  known  or  suspected  to  be helping gang activities and, 
1) Particulars of the complaints received against them. 
1) A complete background files on gangsters and gangs to be used at some stage in investigation and prosecution.  
2) The STF intelligence wing should work out an integrated computer records system which  will,  apart  from  storing  vast  information  will  bring  speed  to  data verification and would also help the investigator to quickly check a complaint in hand  against  past  complaints  of  related  nature  so  as  to  get  a  picture  of  the criminal's or gang's past criminal activities.  
2) Another  important  responsibility  of  the  Criminal  Intelligence  Wing  of  STF 

should  be  the  collection  of  sensitive  and  reliable  intelligence  about  the clandestine and covert activities of organised criminal gangs more importantly their  operational  plans,  their  front  organisations  and  enterprises,  auxiliary members  and  associates  who  lend  support  and  facilitate  gang  survival  and activities. 

4) The information required by the police regarding the activities of the gangs fall in two categories, First, information that can able gleaned from open sources such as newspaper  reports,  articles  and  interviews  appearing  in  news-magazines  and journals, business records pertaining to gang connected business enterprises and so  on.  Second,  information  that  is  not  openly  available.  Apart  from  the information and knowledge culled out from interrogation reports, statements of witness such information can be fruitfully collected through running sources or paid informers.  
4) Important information about daily activities of the gangs can be likewise collected by winning over persons living in localities where gang activities abound and where a gang's headquarters is located. Such sources can be recruited from the residents who had become victims of gang atrocities in the past or are sympathetic to a rival gang. As a matter of fact most gangs collect information about the gangs they are on inimical terms with in this manner. Itinerant sources, that is to say, sources who visit such localities on the pretext of selling wares or services can also  collect  information  by  observation  or  listening  to  chance  unguarded conversations.  
4) As a long term measure, which can reap rich dividends, some budding young criminals with promise can be persuaded to join the gangs. This can be done with ease in jails where most new recruitments take place. When these persons reach positions of vantage in a gang they can provide very valuable information. It is a risky operation that requires professional handling.  
4) It is, therefore, necessary to explore the possibility of using technological sources especially because gangsters do make frequent use of technological innovations the simplest and the most commonly used being the telephone. The police have been  for  decades  tapping  telephones  to  collect  information  clandestinely.  Cellular and digital phones are all set to invade not only metropolitan cities but even the country side. The gangsters who have no dirth of money are sure to make use of these innovations in a big way because of the versatility and relative safety of communication they offer. As it is the gangsters are using telephones installed in secret safe houses, in the flats of friends and associates and the public call offices several of them are now owned by gang affiliates.  

(viii) Short-range transmitters or bugs can be used with considerable advantage in 

such situations provided the requisite homework is done to find out the places of rendezvous and taking the owners in confidence or even otherwise. Similarly a decoy or in the alternative a gang member who has been won over, or a victim of crime can be persuaded to carry a miniature transmitter on his person and his conversation recorded. As a cruder and more risky proposition he can carry a mini-tape recorder in his pocket. Mini cameras concealed in cigarette cases and the like can also be used to take photographs. Such technical evidence coupled with actual deposition of the person who collected the evidence can go a long way in establishing the complicity or criminality of the gangsters. 

9) Actual  physical  surveillance  can  also  be  mounted  either  by  using  trained policemen in plane clothes or hired auxiliary agents on gangsters when they are on  the  move  or  in  their  known  hideouts.  Many  hideouts,  hitherto  unknown members  and  associates  and  rendezvous  joints  can  thus  be  discovered. Photographic evidence obtained during these surveillance errands can later be used in a court of law to establish relationships. 
9) Intelligence information should also be obtained as a standing arrangement on a give and take basis from other enforcement and interested agencies such as State CID, police forces of other States, CBI, IB, R&AW, Enforcement Directorate, Central Excise and Customs Department, Income Tax Department and Narcotics Control Bureau. The list is not exhaustive.   
9) The sources and informers who collect sensitive information, often risking their lives, collect sensitive information, often risking their lives, invariably want to be properly treated by the officers, who liaise with them and of course most of them wants to be well paid the exception occasionally being those who want to seek revenge through police. The police officers should keep all these points in mind while handling informers.  
12) The criminal intelligence wing should form the backbone of the anti-organized crime campaign that the Special Task Force would be expected to launch and pursue relentlessly.  
9) **Awareness and Training Needs :** It is important for the police personnel to understand and appreciated the nature of the problem of the organized crimes vis-à- vis their own roles in tackling that problem. The right step in this context is to educate the whole police force about the true nature of the scourge of organized crime. Such education should start as part of the basic police training to be imparted to police men of all rank at various training schools. It should be made part of the syllabus. This should be followed with periodic in-service short term courses that would update the knowledge of the participants about the reality of the organized crimes and gangs and the method/techniques for tracking the problems. Such training on organized crime and its impact on policing may include following topics: 
1. What constitutes organized crime? i.e. essential features of organized crime 
1. A brief survey of growth of organized crime (a) in important countries in the world (b) in big cities in our country (c) its trans-national aspect 
1. Traditional crimes committed by organized criminal gang both violent and white collar. 
1. Entry of organized crime in legitimate business and its methods of doing so. 
1. How organized crime affects general crime scenario and its impact on society in various fields, social, political and economic. 
1. Laws relating to organized crime 
1. How police fight organized crime 

viii.  Citizen's role and obligation in fighting organized crime and the imperative 

need for enlisting their involvement by the police. 

603\.1 Police officer in the Special Task Force should be given more intensive and ho- to-o it kind of training in order to develop in acute insight and confidence to take actual steps on the ground. Therefore, whenever officers are posted to the Special Task Force they should be given an intensive orientation course preferably on the following lines; 

1. An overview of organized crime activities - national as well as global. 
1. A survey of the international movement to coordinate law enforcement efforts. 
1. Similar efforts among various police forces within the country. 
1. Important gangs operating indigenous as well as outside gangs (a) structures and methods of operation of these gangs (b) their important leaders (c) fields of operation (d) their resources and capabilities and (d) associate organizations and outfits. 
1. Laws and rulings relating to organized criminal activities 
1. Methods of collection of criminal intelligence and its use in investigations, gang case preparation etc. 
1. Modern technical devices and their practical use in intelligence and evidence collection. 

viii.  Organisation and functioning of the Task Force 

ix.  Some typical case studies. 

603\.2 Some Special task Force Officers will have to be frequently apprised of the latest  techniques  of  commission  of  crime  that  have  come  to  notice  locally  and elsewhere, the countermeasures that have been found useful by actually examining cases. They must also be made aware of the latest pronouncements of superior courts that are relevant to organized crime investigation. A detailed critical analysis of the cases that have ended in acquittal must also form part of regular briefings.  

603\.3 The staff posted in STF should be made to go through an intensive course in firing with revolvers, pistols and automatic weapons. Familiarization with improvised explosive  devices  should  also  form  art  of  this  course  which  may  be  held simultaneously with or in succession to the orientation course. Regular firing practice thereafter would be necessary in order to keep the officers in good trim.  

603\.4 The Special Task Force should apprise itself with the methods of operation of professional kidnappers for ransom and the methods of tackling them. Apart from the skills for rescuing a hostage from the clutches of armed gangsters without any harm coming to him, the team would require ability to effectively intercept all forms of communication which is an indispensable concomitant of this form of crime. Some suitable  officers  should  also  be  trained  in  the  craft  of  persuasive  negotiations  or arrangements made on standing basis to obtain service of experienced psychologists. The rescue operation will also require the assistance of the commando unit.  

10) **Administrative and Operational Modalities :** 
1. It should be emphasized on all officers particularly of the Special Task Force that enforcement of law in relation to gang activities should be strictly done every time a violation is reported or noticed, and this should be regarded as the imperative duty of all. 
1. All enforcement techniques, whatever the seeming compulsions of a given situation, should be strictly within the circumscription laid down by law. The temptation to take law into one's own hands and inflict spot justice should be tenaciously suppressed. No supervisory officer should sanction or connive at violations  of  this  dictum  no  matter  what  the  expediency  of  a  situation suggests. Once the seniors turn a blind eye to this kind of unethical behaviour there is no knowing to what depths of de gradation it would sink the force. 
1. It should be repeatedly emphasizes that the campaign against organized crime should be regarded as corporate venture in which all policemen must sincerely contribute their bit whatever their posting.  
1. Nobody, whatever his individual contribution, should be allowed to stay on in the Special Task Force for a longer period than his normal tenure. Period rotations of personnel are the best guarantee against vested interest. 
1. No cliques or groups should be allowed to be formed within the Special Task Force. This can be best ensured by the Head of the Unit by discussing on- going investigations in group meetings and by not allowing a particular team to keep the whole of its information and work secret from others. This is not to say that the principle of restrictive security should be given a go bye but that it should be adhered to more in respect of people who are not part of the Special Task Force. 
1. A small cell comprising officers of known integrity and dedication should be created within the Special Task Force for internal security. The unit should function directly under the Head of the STF. The main brief of this cell will be 

   to  see  that  the  officers  posted  in  the  Special  Task  Force  do  not  get contaminated  by  corrupting  influences  form  outside  and  that  they  do  not blabber away sensitive information to unauthorized persons least it reaches the gangsters. The cell should have the authority to conduct  internal audits of investigations, operations and other activities after obtaining clearance from the Head of the STF. It should also have the authority to conduct an enquiry to find out the kind of contacts and friends the STF personnel have or how they spend their off duty time.  

11) **Sensitizing Prosecution and Judiciary :** An effective control on organized criminal activity is possible only when it is  regarded as the joint and corroborative of the criminal justice system. All components of the criminal justice system must be sensitized to the need for active cooperation in curbing this kind of crime which has assumed  international  proportions  with  monstrous  possibilities  for  the  future.** Orientation courses should be designed for all limbs of the criminal justice system. Perhaps special courses for judges and government prosecutors can be run by apex training  schools  or  the  State  level  every  National  Institute  for  Criminology  and Forensics Science at the National Level. In addition seminars conference, symposia for police, prosecutors, judges and prison authorities both serving and retired, should be periodically organized. Even social scientists and other researchers who have taken interest in studying organized crime should be invited to contribute their ideas about possible solution and make an input about people's perceptions. These seminars will educate the participants about the current trends in organized crime and the damage it is causing to the social fabric, the difficulties faced by each limb of the criminal justice system in playing its respective part more effectively, and thereby work out ways for greater cooperation. They may also throw up new ideas about more effective methods and techniques of combating organized crime. Above all, it will on the one hand enhance sensitivity of the whole criminal justice system and attract attention of the public whose cooperation also is indispensable on the other.**  
11) **Special Enactments and Legal Provisions :** Proactive intelligence and a well trained special team will not be effective enough to crush organized criminal gangs unless there is a special law or laws that would enable the police achieve their goals.** It is indisputable that the stringent provisions governing granting of bail are most desirable in dealing with gangsters who cannot be easily arrested and who invariably go underground when released on bail. In order to put the gangsters out of circulation they  must  in  the  first  instance  not  be  released  on  bail  and  secondly,  must  be expeditiously tried. This is possible only if there is special provision in the law for the purpose.  Organized crime can be effectively curbed when the gangs are hit at several levels simultaneously. It would be necessary for the police to make out a case or cases against most gang members especially those at the top for being members of an outfit that is engaged in illegal activities. An organized criminal gang can really be broken if the most important source of power, i.e. the ill-gotten money is attacked. Therefore, legal provisions must exist that will enable the law enforcement agency to investigate all benami assets of a gang and taken appropriate measures to seize and ultimately confiscate such assets. Once a gang runs short of money several field operators who risk their lives for the money they get in return will desert the gang. The greatest difficulty in proving a case is in the prosecution not being able to produce convincing evidence. This is one of the reasons for the poor rate of convictions in TADA Act cases too. Witnesses do not generally come forward to give evidence before the police and if they do it is only when they cannot avoid it or in rare case they do so in the heat of the moment. Such witnesses invariably do not support the prosecution at the time of the trial.**  
13) **The three Fold Approach to Seek Conviction :** A three-fold approach is called for obtaining conviction for criminals in viewed in organized crimes.**  
1. Making a confession made to a police officer admissible in law creates one great  impediment  which  no  professional  police  officer  would  like.  It invariably inducts a sense of complacency as, the investigating officer tends to feel  that  he  had  thus  established  the  case.  The  case  falls  flat  when  the confession  is  retracted,  shown  as  suffering  from  some  infirmity  or  is  not adequately corroborated. A confession should be regarded only as a reliable beacon light that shows in which direction the investigation should be carried out and what all needs to be established to prove the case. Therefore, in order to  permit  every  kind  of  evidence  available  to  come  before  the  trial  court confession made to a police officer should be made admissible but the police themselves should not totally rely upon it to prove the case.  
1. The  effort should be  that natural witnesses to a crime or criminal activity 

   should depose sincerest treats and honesty in a court of trial. They therefore, need  to  be  given  adequate  protection  which  need  not  be  only  physical. Secondly, those witnesses who resile should be legally made accountable for it in a manner that would deter others from following the same path.  

3. The third most important thing that needs to be done is to increasing reliance on scientific investigation that makes use of modern technology. There should be adequate enabling in the law itself so that police are able to tap these and produce the evidence thus available before the trial. 
14) **Justice not to be Delayed :**  Delays in court to take up a case for trial and disposed off expeditiously by not holding hearings in quick succession belittle efforts of  the  law  enforcement  agencies.  The  court  procedures,  therefore,  have  to  be streamlined  and  it  should  be  ensured  that  a  criminal  does  most  merrily  go  on committing crimes, intimidating and even killing witnesses. A criminal when gets convicted promptly goes in appeal and when the appeal is admitted he is released on bail. This practically nullifies the conviction. The appeal takes its own time to get listed for hearing. At times even leniency is shown in awarding punishment. It is necessary,  therefore,  that  a  minimum  punishment  that  would  by  itself  act  as  a deterrent is laid down in law. Even prescribing minimum amount of punishment in the body of the Act itself has not brought about any improvement due to disconcerting lack of sensitivity towards social ills and over concern for human liberty to antisocial elements and the criminals. It is emphatically stressed that a new law covering all aspects  of  organized  crime's  multi-faceted  and  multi-dimensional  activities,  is  the crying need of the day. No attempt has been made here to submit a draft bill. Some legal luminaries in the Govt. of India would surely undertake that task once the need is  accepted.  It  has  to  be  realized,  however,  that  a  legislation  that  is  intended  to effectively grapple with a social malady should not be left to the legal experts alone to formulate. A comprehensive and holistic endeavour is required in the matter.**  
14) **People Participation for Effective Control on Organized Crime :** If citizens are  unaware  of  the  true  nature  and  dimensions  of  organized  crime,  and  how  it eventually affects even a law abiding citizen, there is little hope that the relentless growth  of  organized  crime  will  be  halted.  It  has  to  be  realized  that  the  ultimate prevention  and  control  of  any  crime  depends  the  citizen  awareness  and  public cooperation. The common public should be made aware of the danger that organized crime poses to them. This will build public pressure that will ultimately squeeze out organized crime. Similarly public spirited voluntary bodies should be enthused to take p uprooting of organized crime as their primary task. These organizations in the first instance should take up the responsibility of educating people about the sinister nature of organized crime. Further, they can in conjunction with the police launch campaigns to see that young men do not join these gangs. The public bodies can also serve as eyes and ears of the law enforcement machinery. In other words they can serve as intelligence sources and thus render yeoman's service to the cause of organized crime suppression. As a corollary they should encourage witnesses to come forward and help police. Later, they can help keep up the courage of these witnesses so that they also truthfully depose during trial. These organizations should truly launch a citizen's war  on  organized  crime  in  which  risky  endeavour  they  must  get  whole  hearted support from the police.  In order to institutionalize this arrangement it would be a good idea for the city police chief to constitute an inter-action committee of activist voluntary organizations and a few dedicated individuals. The Committee can discuss action taken against organized crime, exchange views on what needs to be done and formulate future police thrusts.**  

    **New Horizons of Overall Cooperation** 

    604\. It would be naive on the part of any police organization to believe that it can contain much less eradicate the menace of organized crime on its own. Organized crime and related gang activities are now spreading from metropolitan cities to not only  the  remote  suburbs  and  satellite  townships  but  also  to  other  large  urban conglomerates. In such a situation, no single police force can fight any of these gangs single handed. Frequent interaction, exchange of information among affected police forces  and  an  understanding  that  will  allow  them  to  operate  in  one  another's jurisdiction either on their own or in conjunction and occasional joint planning of operations are indispensable for giving worthwhile fight to these highly mobile, well armed are resource rich gangs.  Therefore, the preferable line of action would be that, 

1. The Commissioner of Police or DGP or the senior most officer in charge of the Crime Branch should organize frequent exchange of information between the Special Task Force and other units of police and Crime Branch so that the Special Task Force gets the necessary support from other Units. 
2. It is desirable to convene periodic meetings among various units of police. These meetings should be attended by executive police crime branch official, STF personnel of investigation, Intelligence Bureau and perhaps Research and Analyzing Wing.  
2. In all round attack has to be launched against organized in order to subdue them. Considering the kinds of criminal activities they indulge in, it will be highly  desirable  to  associate  with  any  police  action  plan  such  other enforcement  agencies  as  the  Central  Excise  and  Customs  Department,  the Income Tax Department, the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau so that each agency would initiate action under its own authority and power to debilitate a gang that has been earmarked for action. A collaboration of this nature will also greatly facilitate a thorough investigation in a crime committed by a gang.  
2. The Crime branch should have a small cell devoted exclusively to the task of organizing these meetings and to ensure prompt follow up action. Since gang activities  are  spread  over  more  than  one  States  a  similar  arrangement  for exchange of information must exist among all the affected States. The Central Bureau of Investigation should act as the nodal agency for organizing such interactions.  
2. Since organized crime has crossed national frontiers it would be necessary to establish close links with countries which seem to show similar concern for control of organized crime, more so with those countries where the Indian gangsters appear to be operating or taking shelter. The objective should be to enhance understanding of one another's problems, thereby increasing chances of  cooperation  in  respect  of  sharing  gang  related  criminal  intelligence. Organized  crime  is  not  only  deeply  entrenched  in  several  other  countries including  developed  countries  but  is  increasingly  taking  advantage  of  the readily  available  new  technologies.  It  would  be  of  considerable  benefit  to know the methods of operation adopted by organized gangs in those countries and  how  they  are  being  effectively  countered  so  that  tomorrow  when  the indigenous gangs bring those technologies in use the police would know how to deal with them.  

**The Expanding Horizons** 

605\. It should be evident that Organized Crime is a growth industry not only in India but also in several other countries. In India, Organised Crime initially got roots in  big  cities  like  Bombay  and  Delhi,  but  now  other  metropolitan  cities  like Calcutta,  Madras  and  Bangalore  and  even  the  other  cities  particularly  the capital  headquarters  of  the  States cannot be immune from this scourge, for the incubation factors are available there too in abundant measure. It is axiomatic that so long as these cities continue to produce educationally deficient, socially misfit because of lack of family care, and economically unemployable youths who have no credible notion of economic opportunity ahead; youths who have nothing to look forward to that will give them  a sense of belonging and achievement, the ranks of organised criminal gangs are bound to swell. From purely criminal acts like extortion with all its variants, trafficking in illicit services and goods, it is bound to step into in fact in several instances it has already done so legitimate business and allied forms of financial activities where it is sure to give free rein to its fondness for using violence, to amass huge profits and in the process establish its own stranglehold and monopoly over these commercial activities.  

606\. **The Basic Components of the new Strategy**  

1) Organised gang activity has not remained a localised urban phenomenon alone but has spread its tentacles into country side as well as can be easily gleaned from what is happening in Utttar Pradesh, Bihar and elsewhere. What is worse, it has become trans-national  which  has  opened  vast  avenues  for  it  to  generate  easy  money. International  cooperation  in  the  field  of  countering  organised  crime  is  gaining momentum  elsewhere  because  the  problem  has  assumed  frightening  proportions. Therefore, it is imperative for police and other law enforcement agencies that they develop a sound strategy to combat organised criminal activities  at  home  and  a  conscious  policy  to  join  the international  cooperative  efforts  by  governments,  so  that  a  synergistic  multi-pronged  attack  could  be  launched  with  a  view  to eradicating organised gangs and their concerted criminal activities.  
2) Further, the police and the other law enforcement agencies in the country which have a vital role to play and without whose willingness to support and cooperate the police would be considerably handicapped, must launch a concerted attack on the organised criminal gangs with a view to incapacitating the top leadership as well as the lower echelons down to the foot soldier.   More specifically it should be their endeavour  to  secure  for  the  leaders  and  the  second  line  leadership  as  well  long sentences of imprisonment. Putting one or two top leaders of the gang behind bars causes them only minor inconvenience, if at all.  
2) The second front should be opened against their money power. Financially these gangs must be crippled then only their back would be broken. This in fact holds the key to success in the war against organized crime. A gang will collapse the moment money and the ability to earn it cheap is taken away from it.   
2) These  important  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  unless the  police  re-structure themselves  to  create  special  units  of  dedicated  professionals  who  are  good  at  systematic  and painstaking investigations and at fighting it out in the streets when it comes to that.   Of course their hands will have to be reinforced with a legislation that  takes  into  account  the  special  problems  created  by  the  organised  crime  in launching prosecutions and aims at destroying the menace, and by creating a socially sensitive judiciary that would realise the need of the hour and contribute its share which cannot be mean by any reckoning.  
2) People's  cooperation,  support  and  involvement  are  equally  indispensable.  No social malignancy has ever been eradicated without people's active support which in this case will come only when people are made aware of the true nature of organised crime and how it affects them in the long term too, and then encouraged to rise against it together.  
2) However, before any such grand national strategy is worked out it would be necessary  to  study  this  phenomenon  of  organised  criminal  gangs  formation  and activities in its various manifestations in other metropolitan cities as well as in rural areas.

**Cyber Crimes and Police** 

**Introduction** 

607\.  Due  to  information  technology  revolution;  computers  and  the  computer networks are now within the reach of citizens, businessmen and public authorities. Computer  technology  has  wide  applications  at  home,  in  business,  in  industry, commercial establishments and in public offices for data processing and storing vital information.  The  information  technology  now  encompasses  the  entire  gamut  of human activity. The computer and computer networks have opened new vistas for various segments of the society and business, and they are also being used as tools by criminals. An extensive use of computers has made our life increasingly dependent on them. The need to protect the areas of computer use from crime has become extremely important. The financial system, transportation systems, public records, manufacturing processes and the information infrastructure are amenable to attack by cyber criminals. The number, economic cost and sophistication of such attacks at the hands  of  educated  criminals  will  be  on  increase  in  the  days  to  come.  The international  communication  networks  and  omnipresent  Internet  have  erased  the national  boundaries  and  the  computer  crimes  are  increasingly  becoming international, both in their scope and ramifications. This poses a new challenge for the police and other law enforcement authorities to ensure that users of computer and computer networks do not become victims of computer/cyber crime and also to take up investigation of this new generation of offences with the requisite competence and professional vision.

**Computer Basics** 

608\. For dealing with computer related crime, it is essential for the police to have the basic knowledge of computers. A computer is a machine that carries out logical instructions  in  a  predetermined  manner.  It  is  programmed  to  perform  certain operations and store large amount of information depending upon its capacity. The computer networks consist of number of computers connected with each other by various means and is capable of sharing and transferring information between one

other. The information or data stored in a computer can be retrieved or transferred, or used in an output form in number of ways.

**Components of Computer System**  

609\. A typical computer consists of 'input device', 'output device', 'central processing unit' and 'memory'. The input devices are used to feed the data or instruction in a computer from the user or from another computer system. A keyboard ,  a mouse, a magnetic tape drive, a disk derive such as floppy disk derive, CD drive, DVD drive,  any kind of electric sensor, a digital camera, a microphone ,   a bar coding reading machine and  scanners etc. are input devices.

**The Output Devices** 

610\.  The  output  devices  receive  processed  data  for  the  user  or  another  compute system. Some of the output devices are: a visual display unit also known as monitor, a printer which produces 'hard copies' of the output,   magnetic tapes, cassettes, disks such as floppy disks, CDs, DVDs etc., 

**The CPU** 

611\. The central processing unit (CPU) can be described as mind of the computer. It carries out the instructions that have been pre-programmed into it either by the user or  by  software.  In  a  typical  personal  computer,  the  central  processing  unit  may consist of one or more microprocessors - also called chips. It generally has memory store,  which  is  measured  in  units  known  as  Kilobytes  (Kb),  Megabyte;  (Mb), Gigabytes, (Gb) and Terabyte (Tb). It also has unit which processes the information. Central  processing  systems  use  "operating  systems",  which  govern  the  way  the computer operates. Some of the popular operating systems are MS DOS, Windows, UNIX, Linux etc.  The memory is important component to the investigator- for this is where evidence is likely to be obtained. The memory is generally classified as temporary  memory  and  permanent  memory.  Temporary  memory  is  known  as Random Access Memory (RAM) or read/write memory, which can be altered or erased The information contained in RAM is not saved or transferred to other storage media  and  it  is  lost  the  moment  power  source  in  disconnected.  The  permanent memory, known as Read Only Memory (ROM) cannot be altered or erased.

482

**Computer Hardware** 

612\. The mechanical devices that constitute the computer are called hardware. The hardware  can be seen  and felt.  The hardware  consists  of various inter-connected electronic  devices  such  as  processors,  video  screens,  printers  and  several  other peripherals such as disk drives, CD writers etc.

**Computer Software** 

613\. The hardware by itself cannot do any data processing. It requires electronic instructions  that  drive  a  computer  or  any  other  hardware  component  to  perform specific tasks. Any computer software, information / data are organised in a structure of files, software in programme files and information in data files. Though there are number'  of  software  programme,  these  can  be  broadly  categorized  into  'system software' and 'application software'

**Classification of Computers** 

614\.  The  descriptions  of  various  types  of  computers  are  given  in  the  following paragraphs:

1. **Super Computers:** Super Computers are generally the largest and most powerful computers made to process huge amount of data and carry out large number of calculations per second.   The scientists and engineers generally use the Super Computers.  Due to their size and cost, Super Computers are very rare and only used by large corporations, universities and government agencies. 
2. **Main Frame Computers:** The largest of a computer, which is commonly used  for  processing  huge  volume  of  data,  are  called  Main  Frame Computers. These are normally used in large organizations like insurance companies, banks and airlines, where same data need to be accessed by several  people.  Main  Frame  Computers  are  also  used  for  providing services  on  the  internet.  Retrieving  evidence  from  a  Main  Frame Computer may require a high degree of expertise. 
3. **Mini Computers:** Mini Computer systems are smaller computers but  have  large  capacity  for  processing  the  data.  These  are normally  used  as  servers  and  provide  network  to  number  of users and are capable of data sharing with the linked computer systems. 
3. **Work Stations:** Work Stations are normally used for specialized purpose by single user. These normally have processing power of a mini computer and are used by scientists, engineers, graphic artists, programmers etc. 
3. **Microcomputers / Personal Computers:** These are generally used by individuals for various applications. These days, with advanced  technology,  processing  power  of  microcomputers often  drives  that  of  workstations  or  mini  computers.  These computers  may  also  be  used  with  network  interface  card  to connect to the network of an organization or to the Internet, 
3. **Note Book / Laptop computers:** Note Book / Laptop computers, as  the  name  suggests,  are  smaller  portable  versions  of  micro computers and can perform any function of a micro computer. These computers can be carried anywhere and can be connected to the network through physical or wireless interface. 
3. **Hand  held  computers:**  The  past  few  years  have  seen introduction of many hand held personal computers, which are also called on Palmtop Computers or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). These are small portable computers less powerful than microcomputers providing services on the internet. 

**Computers Networks** 

615\. A network of computers can be defined as several computers connected with each other through cables or wireless, so as to capable of sharing various kinds of information / data. Generally, main types of networks i.e. Local Area Network (LAN) and Wind Area Network (WAN) are in use these days. 

1. **A Local Area Network (LAN)** can be defined as a network of computers located in vicinity. These are normally connected by cable, an Infra red link or through a radio transmitter. The data is normally shared by these computers through certain software protocols, which are a set of rules and forms for sending and receiving data. TCP / IB is one of the most popular protocol, which is in use these days for exchange of data. 
1. **Wide Area Network (WAN)** can be defined as network of two or more LANs  connected  together  covering  a wide  geographical  area. A  WAN may link computers situated in one country or across various countries. The computers in WAN may be connected through high speed telephone lines, fibre optics, under sea cables or through satellites, 

**Storage Devices**  

616\. The data / information is often stored on what is known as storage media. The hardware component, on which, data can be written and read from it, is also known as storage device. There are two main categories of storage technology, which exist today i.e. magnetic storage and optical storage. Certain storage devices / media may employ  both  kind  of  technology.  For  detailed  description,  any  standard  book  on storage devices may be referred to. 

1. **Primary Storage Devices** 

617\. The primary type of magnetic storage devices are as follows: 

- Diskette 
- Hard Disk (could be fixed or removable) 
- High capacity floppy disks 
- Disk cartridges 
- Magnetic tape 
- Cards (credit and debit cards etc.) 
2. **Optical Storage Devices** 

618\. The various types of Optical Storage devices are as follows: 

- Compact Disk Read-Only Memory (CD-ROM) 
- Digital Video Disk Read-Only Memory (DVD-ROM) 
- CD-Re-cordable (CD-R) 
- CD-Re-Writable (CD-RW) 
- Photo CD 

**Computer Crimes** 

619\.  Given  the  dynamic  nature  of  information  technology,  communication infrastructure  and  ever  changing  legal  measures  towards  better  effort  to  prevent computer  /  cyber  offences,  the  paragraphs  that  follow  are  not  a  comprehensive description of computer crime. The police officers should consult computer/cyber crime manual and also to refer to the latest legal provisions on the subject.

**Cyber/Computer Crime : Conceptualization** 

620\. There is no universal accepted definition of computer / cyber crime but broadly in  general  parlance,  the  computer  crime  is  any  illegal  or  unauthorized  activity involving  computers.  The  crime  can  be  against  an  individual  or  organization  or against the nation endangering or threatening to endanger its integrity and security. Such an illegal or unauthorized act  may  manifest in, preventing the computer to perform its duties as designed, or slow down its operations, or corrupting or copying the data or software. A computer crime can thus broadly define as commission, or attempt  or  abetment  to  the  commission  of  any  one  or  any  combination  of  the following illegal/unauthorized activities.

1. unauthorized access, alteration, addition, deletion or hiding data; 
1. unauthorized access, alteration,   addition,   deletion or hiding   programme or information; 
1. stealing of data, programme in any manner; 
1. unauthorized (physical/logical) entry into computer work environment;  
1. change or alter the defined system. 

**Modus Operandi of the Cyber Crimes** 

621\.  Digital  or  electronic  tress-passing  requires  very  few  tools  such  as  home computer, or a note book computer or a desk top personal computer, a modem and a telephone  line.  The  criminal  first  identifies  and  breaks  into  the  communication channel to which the computer is connected. This may be a dial up line connected to telephone line or a leased line connected to a telephone line or to the public data system network. He then tries to log into the system by trying out various passwords or stolen password. For an insider to gain unauthorized access to the system becomes all the easier. In the case of stand-alone systems, his job becomes easy once he gets physical access to the system.

**Computer Hacking** 

622\. This is, also known as intruding or cracking, a practice of gaining unauthorized access  to  a  networked  computer  from  a  remote  source.  It  involves  decoding  of password, breaking into the system and unauthorized use of system. Electronic eves dropping could also be used as a method by hackers for interception of computer services. This is a serious problem as most major computer systems in the world are on the computer network. By this method the offences that can be committed are forgery, sabotage and unauthorized access for interception. Hacking is defined under section  66  of  I.T.  Act  2000.  In  cracking,  normally  the  perpetrator  makes  minor changes  in  the  programme,  in  violation  of  the  copyright  restrictions  with  the objective of extracting information, illegally. 

**Other Type of Computer Crimes** 

623\. Software Piracy and other Copyright Violations, Cyber Pornography, Cyber Terrorism and introducing deliberately the virus etc. are the other type of Computer Crimes. This list will keep on growing with the growth of the computers and the Information  Technology.  Virus  is  the  latest  and  the  most  destructive  type  of identified computer crime. It has the capacity of instantaneously multiplying and attaching themselves to programme under certain circumstances. They can damage computer systems, programs and data. A programmer writes a virus which is nothing more  than  a  few  lines  of  numbers  or  letters  that  instruct  the computer  to  change  or  destroy  information  inside  another  computer.  The  virus instructions  are  hidden  inside  a  legitimate  program  -  one  that  might  contain  a spreadsheet or a word processing programme. It can in fact be through a disc or even through  phone  lines.  The  computer  reads  the  virus  along  with  the  real  software program.  The  computer  reacts  to  the  hidden  virus  instruction.  It  might  tell  the computer  to  destroy  information  on  a  certain  date  or  simply  flash  a  harmless message  on  screen.  It  might  also  tell  computer  to  put  a  copy  of  the infected software on every other disc inserted into the machine. A virus can spread from  computer  to  computer  system  over  a  telephone  line  and  electronic  bulletin boards and floppies / discs. It can damage the computer memory and knock out the total system. 

624\. **Investigation of Computer Crime : Some Precautions** 

1. Unlike collection of evidence in normal crime, the collection of computer evidence on any scene of crime requires specialist care. Serious problems could  arise  if the  computer  evidence  is  not  collected  properly  and  with necessary specialist care.  Therefore, the investigators are advised that they may  call  for  specialist  of computer  crime  unit  of  Crime  Investigating Department  or  computer  forensic scientist  from  the  Forensic  Science Laboratory. 
1. Whenever the investigators comes across a computer during investigation of any crime, he should remember that it could be a valuable piece of equipment and could contain quantity of data, which could lead to valuable evidence for the crime being investigated. Therefore, preservation of the same becomes important from the point of view of evidence. Any mistake in preserving the evidence could result in loss of valuable evidence. On the other hand, any mishandling could also result in huge economic loss to the owner of such computer,  which  must  be  avoided  at  every  cost.  The  investigator  must remember that computers could frequently be connected in a network and the vital necessary evidence might have been transmitted or stored at a location different from the site of the search. The information could be stored even across the boundaries of the country. The investigating officer must therefore be extremely careful whenever he comes across a network of computers. It may  also  be  necessary  to  involve  a  computer  expert  at  the  earliest  as investigator may not be equipped to collect various kinds of data storage on magnetic or optical media.
3. If the investigator has prior knowledge that the scene of crime which is going to be searched would have computer systems or computer network in place, it is  advisable  to  contact  the  specialist  computer  crime  unit  of  Crime Investigation Department or computer forensic scientist of Forensic Science Laboratory. In  case  it  is possible,  advanced  information  may  be  collected regarding the make, model, operating system, network connections etc. being used by the organization or individual, whose premises is being searched, as this information could prove valuable. The information so collected must be passed on to the expert, who can make necessary preparation that may be required to collect evidence. This is necessary, as many a times, it may not be possible  to  remove  the  computer  systems  physically  and  the  data  or programme may have to be copied as per provision of Indian Evidence Act on the crime scene itself. The investigator or the expert, who may accompany the police personnel going for search should carry necessary media in the form of disk,  floppy  disks,  optical  disks,  tapes,  tools,  software,  labels  and  other specialized  items  and  should  carry  necessary  packing  material,  which  can prevent  loss  of  evidence  collected  as  offered  on  such  media  as  data  on magnetic  media  can  be  destroyed  by  media,  dust  and  electrostatic environment.
3. In case computer equipment is to be removed, necessary care would have to be taken to pack it properly and if necessary the material which will prevent any damage, as sometimes read write heads could malfunction if subjected to sudden jerk or force should be arrange for packing. If the computer system at crime scene happens to be large, special attention may be required for proper transport  and  storage  arrangements,  so  that,  data  contained  therein  is preserved for the purpose of evidence. If necessary and possible, the place which  contains  such  computers  could  be  sealed  and  guarded  properly  till arrangement is made to collect the evidence.
5. During  the  course  of  the  search,  the  investigator  must  not,  under  any circumstances, allow a suspect or accused to touch any part of the computer system. It must be remembered that even a press of a key could erase the entire data. These days, it is even possible to enter or delete data with the help of remote keyboards and mouse. Hence care should be taken that suspect or accused does not have possibility of passing any instructions to the computer through any of such devices. Sometimes, it may be desirable / necessary for suspect  or  accused  to  be  present  during  the  search  to  collect  valuable information especially if data is protected by user identities or passwords. In such situations, the investigator must be careful to keep the suspect / accused out of reach of computer system and must not try to recover data by using the identities or passwords told by such person. He should invariably take help of an expert under such circumstances.
5. Now-a-days, most of the computers are part of the network, which may be connected through cables, radio links, telephone, fibre optics etc. In a network individual computer systems may function as stand alone machines also may contain significant data / programmes. On the other hand, the information could be found elsewhere in a physically remote area as server connected in the  network.  Therefore,  it  is  important  that  help  of  an  expert  is  taken  to identify where the storage is located. The type of storage arrangement in use in  a  network  would  determine  the  search  and  seizure  procedures.  It  is, therefore,  necessary  that  when  a  network  environment  is  to  be  searched, adequate technical personnel along with general investigator must be assigned for the job. In case, it is found that the server or data storage is located outside the boundaries of India, prompt necessary action has to be taken through a competent court to issue a "letters rogatory" under the provisions of section 166(A) CrPC. The assistance of National Crime Bureau (N.C.B.) represented by Central Bureau of Investigation may be taken in this regard.
7. It may therefore be necessary to ensure that the suspect / accused is not able to temper with the information contained in the computers at the time of the search. The investigator is well advised to take help of an expert to ensure that  all  such  connections  are  removed  and  data  communication  facilities disabled at the earliest.

**Search and Seizure of Evidence Contained in Computer Systems** 

625\. The actual collection / seizure of evidence should take place after all necessary steps  have  been  taken.  It  may  be  necessary  to  associate  an  expert  or  a  forensic specialist before carrying out the search and seizure procedure. Few precautions and steps taken during the search are detailed below :

1. The system should be observed carefully and the name and the model number of the system should be noted. It is necessary to prevent  loss  or  corruption  of  evidence  and  to  ensure preservation of quality of evidence.
1. Under  no  circumstances,  crime  suspect  /  accused  should  be allowed  to  touch  a  computer  system  or  use  remote  control devices,  which  can  manipulate  the  data  /  programmes contained in the computer systems.
1. The suspect / accused or anybody else must not be allowed to remove anything from the scene or carry out any activities on the computers. It must be remembered the computers/ video screens, printers and other peripheral devices may also contain valuable  evidence,  which  could  be  destroyed,  if  anybody  is permitted to handle these equipments. In case, no technical / expert  assistance  is  available,  and  the  investigator  is  not trained to handle such computer systems, it may be advisable to leave computers on the scene as it is, till technical assistance arrives.
4. In  case,  computer  systems  are  found  working,  it  may  be necessary  to  power  down  these  with  the  help  of  experts depending upon the operating system in use. Care should be taken to use the shut down system of the operating system and not  shut  off  power  as  that  could  result  in  loss  of  data  / programme, which may make recovery of evidence extremely difficult and even impossible.
4. Before  disconnecting  and  dismantling  any  computer component,  even/thing  must  be  labeled,  initiated  with  date along with the signatures of witnesses as per provisions of law. Special  care  should  be  taken  to  label  and  document  all  the cables.  The  corresponding  labels  must  be  placed  on  the devices,  which  are  connected  with  particular  cables  and  if necessary a descriptive labeling system i.e. LPT1, Serial Port etc. may be used.
4. It  may  be  extremely  useful  and  necessary  to  take  close  up photography both still and video of all the individual pieces of hardware and connections. The investigator may also draw a diagram of the location of the various computer systems.
4. The equipment available at the scene must not be dismantled by the investigator and the job shall be best left to a specialist, who may disable a network/remove the peripherals first and then the computer system.

**VIII.**  Any documentation or notes or scratch paper etc. found at the 

scene must be scrutinized properly and seized. Many a times, these  could  give  important  clues  regarding  passwords  and other information.

9. In  case,  the  scene  of  crime  contains  multiple  computer systems, care must be taken to keep one system separate from the other and the peripherals attached to such system must be marked and packed separately, so that they do not get mixed- up.
9. The investigator is cautioned that when no expert is available, he should not try to handle the system as due to any improper handling, there is a risk of tempering the evidence available therein. Switching or disconnection of power may result in loss of temporary memory (RAM), which will create difficulties in re-gaining access to the system and collection of evidence by the  expert.  Even  if  the  investigator  is  conversant  with computer, keying in instructions could overwrite data and can be construed as interfering with the evidence. Therefore, care should be  taken  to  have expert  assistance  available also  for preserving the evidence.
9. The  investigator  should  remember  that  sometimes  the computer may appear no: to be working but actually it could be  in  hibernation  /  sleep  mode  and  it  might  no:  have  been turned off. Some computer especially laptops work with the help  of  batteries  and  therefore  care  should  be  taken  for handling such systems for collecting the evidence.

626\. **Analysis of Computer Evidence**

1. The evidence collected from scene of a crime from computer system(s) must be sent to forensic laboratory for examination by computer forensic experts or any other designated expert as per the. provisions of Indian Evidence Act Forensic laboratory may make a copy of the data seized analysis and should not work on the original as the data  on re  media seized is required to be produced in the court as an evidence, and it my get destroyed  or  altered  if  the  process  of  analysis  is  done  on  the  original 

   stored data. 

2. The investigator must ensure that all equipment tapes, disks, peripherals etc.  must  be  stored  in  a  dust  free  environment  under  regulated temperature.  The  investigator  is  well  advised  to  consult  an  expert  for properly  storing  the  equipment  and  other  seized  material.  The investigation into computer crimes should be done by police officers who have the necessary experience and training in the field.  

**The Legal Penal Provisions** 

627\. The various types of computer crimes may fall within the ambit of existing provisions of Indian Penal Code or **Chapter-XI** of **Information Technology Act, 2000.**  These  offences  and  their  nature  are  rot  being  discussed  here  and  the investigators may consult some of the books published on the subject and manual on Computer Crime published by International Criminal Police Organisations (Interpol). The  relevant  definitions  and  sections  in  **Chapter  -  XI**  entitled  "Offences"  of **Information  Technology  Act,  2000**  should  be  thoroughly  understood  by  an  IO doing investigation of cyber crime.

Chapter 503 

**Crime Against Women** 

**Introduction** 

648\.  Women  are  quiet  important  and  vital  part  of  any  community,  because  in addition to their quality contribution in the social, familial, political and economic spheres, quantitatively  also they occupy significant  position  in any society, in  as much as, almost 50% of the total population consists of them. Their contribution to the  overall  social  progress,  family  cohesiveness  and  in  the  overall  national development has always been quite significant. The unfortunate part of their destiny is that they become victims of various types of crimes, despite the fact that a number of legislations providing protection to women exist. Although women may be victim of any of the crimes such as murder, robbery, cheating etc., only the crimes, which are directed specifically against women, are characterized as crime against women. These are broadly classified under two categories.

1) **The crimes under the Indian Penal Code (IPC)** 
1. Rape (Sec. 376 IPC) 
1. Kidnapping & Abduction for different purposes (Sec. 363 - 373 IPC) 
1. Homicide for Dowry, Dowry Deaths or their attempts (Sec. 302/304-B IPC) 
1. Torture, both mental and physical (Sec. 498-A IPC) 
1. Molestation (Sec. 354 IPC) 
1. Sexual Harassment (Sec. 509 IPC) 
1. Important of girls (upto 21 years of age) (Sec. 366-B IPC) 
2) **The Crimes under the Special & Local Laws (SLL)** 

649\.  Although  all  laws  are  not  gender  specific,  the  provisions  of  law  affecting women significantly have been reviewed periodically and amendments carried out to keep  pace  with  the  emerging  requirements.   The  gender specific  laws  for  which crime statistics are recorded in the country are : 

1. Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 
1. Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 
1. The Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1979 

503

4. Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986 
4. Commission of Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987 

**Some Basic Issues** 

650\. Some of the basic issues which are important in relation to crime against women are following : 

- Women are an easy target of violence 
- Major part of domestic violence consists of violence against women. 
- Violence against women has a direct and indirect bearing on the phenomena of domestic violence. 
- Violence against women may or may not form part of crime against women but this definitely is violence of Human Rights. 
- This signifies the role of H.R. in violence against women. 
- Enormity and seriousness of atrocities committed against women are a matter of serious concern for every right thinking person. 
- The battle of crime against women has to be waged by 
1. Various sections of I he society 
1. Various campaigns and various programmes 
1. With social support, legal protection, safeguards and reforms in CJS 

**The Causes** 

651\. Some of the important causes for crime against women are following : 

- Lack of awareness 
- Illiteracy and backwardness 
- Oppressive practices and customs 
- Male chauvinism and ego 
- Economic, emotional and social dependence.  

**The Consequences** 

652\. Crimes against women have serious consequences for the family, community, society and the nation. Some of these consequences are following: 

- Lop sided development 
- Fall in sex ratio 

505

- High infant mortality rate 
- Low literacy rate 
- High drop out of girls 
- Low wages 
- Inadequate  socio-politico and economic progress 

**Rape: The Worst Form of Crime Against Woman** 

653\. Rape is a heinous offence that destroys the dignity, self esteem and honour of a woman. Society looks upon a rape victim with apathy, hatred and disgrace. It is a  blot  on  her  matrimonial  prospects,  if  un-married,  and  a  disruption  in  her matrimonial life, if married. The rapist deserves the highest condemnation socially and legally. According to the definition in section 375 I PC, a man is said to commit 'rape' who has sexual intercourse with a woman under any of the six circumstances described under section 375 of the IPC. 

**Aggravated Forms of Rape** 

654\. The more aggravated forms of rape have been defined under section 376 (2) of IPC as mentioned below with enhanced punishments. 

1. If  a  police  officer  commits  rape  within  his  police  station  limits  or  in  the premises of any police station or on a woman in his custody or in the custody of his subordinate; 
1. If any other public servant taking advantage of his official position commits rape on any woman in his custody or in the custody of his sub-ordinate; 
1. Wherever being on the management or on the staff of a jail, remand home, or other place of custody established under/by law or of a woman or children's institution takes advantage of his official position and commits rape on any inmate; 
1. Wherever  being  on  the  management  or  on  the  staff  of  a  hospital,  takes advantage  of  his  official  position  and  commits  rape  on  a  woman  in  that hospital; 
5. Wherever commits rape on a woman knowing her to be pregnant; 

F   Wherever commits rape on a woman under 12 years of age; and G. Wherever commits gang rape; 

**The Parameter of Consent** 

655\. Submission without resistance does not necessarily amount consent. Consent of the victim girl obtained by giving false promise of marriage and her age being 16 years at the time of occurrence is no consent under law. The consent must be free and be given prior to the act. Helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion or passive submission when the volitional faculty is either clouded by fear or vitiated by duress can not be deemed to be consent. 

656\. **Investigation of Rape Case : Some Precautions** 

1. The investigating officer must make careful enquiries to find out if other evidence corroborates the statement of the victim. Corroboration may be by  direct  or  circumstantial  evidence,  which  should,  in  addition  to confirming  that  the  offence  was  committed,  establish  that  the  accused committed  it.  Courts  have  generally  found  no  reason  to  disbelieve  the statement of victim unless circumstances exist that prove her to be false. Facilities are afforded  during  trial or  other  proceedings  that  enable  the victim  to  depose  fearlessly  and  to  overcome  natural  and  societal inhibitions, by in camera proceedings. 
1. Immediately after the case of rape is reported, the FIR should be lodged and the victim should be sent to the medical examination at the earliest accompanied by a woman police officer. IO should remember that as per the definition of the rape, it is not always necessary that rape is clinically proved. Mere penetration is sufficient to constitute the offence of rape. Hence absence of semen or injuries on the victim does not mean that rape is not committed. When a woman submits to the commission of rape out of fear or threat, obviously there will be no injuries or marks of resistance. I.O. should also request the medical officer to whom the victim is sent for medical examination, to examine the private parts of victim and for the removal  of  semen  or  any  hair  from  the  vagina  and  pubic  region.  The examination  of  private  parts  of  both  victim  and  accused  for  injuries, presence of blood, semen or hair and evidence of a venereal disease should be done by a medical officer. Under no circumstances IO himself at the place  of  occurrence  or  in  police  station  or  at  any  other  place  should attempt this examination. 
3. The scene of offence should be visited, photographed, video graphed and thoroughly  examined  by  IO  for  any  material  incidence.  The  accused should  be  arrested  and  sent  with  his  wearing  apparel  for  medical examination if the apprehension is immediately after the commission of offence. If there is delay in arrest, the clothes, which he was wearing at the time of the commission of offence, should be seized and sent for medical examination. 

**Points for Consideration With Regard to Victims** 

657\. In the case of the victim of a rape case following points should be noted : 

1. The exact time and duration of the incident 
1. Age 
1. the character of the woman; 
1. the place where the offence was committed, and whether her cries could reach some one in the vicinity; 
1. whether she was drugged, if so, by whom; 
1. injuries to the body, their nature and position particularly nail or teeth marks  on  the  cheeks  or  the  other  parts  of  the  victim's  body,  injuries around the wrist, forearms or other parts caused by broken bangle pieces; 
1. presence of marks on external clothing when the offence is alleged to have been committed outside a house including torn portions of clothing 
1. presence of semen or blood stains on her person or on the clothes; 
1. injuries to private parts and presence of blood or semen or any foreign hair in or near the vagina or other parts of the body or on the clothes 
10. in the case of young and unmarried girls ruptures of hymen and whether the rupture is recent; 
10. whether  the  victim  has  been  infected  with  any  venereal  diseases,  and 
10. the  condition  of  pubic  hair,  whether  mixed  with  semen  or  blood, 

**The Accused**

658\. In the case of accused, following points should be noted : 

1. age and   physical development; 
1. injuries  to  his  person,  face,  neck,  and  in  the  neighbourhood  of genitals; 
1. tearing of clothes; 
1. presence of blood or semen stains on his person or clothes or pubic hair. Blood and saliva should be collected for DNA if necessary. 
1. injuries to the male organ ; 
1. presence of foreign hair on the body/clothes of the accused;  

**The Place of Occurrence** 

659\. At the place of occurrence, following points should be noted: 

1. marks  of struggle  like  trampling  of  the  ground  if  it  is  grassy  or marshy. 
1. broken bangle pieces etc. 
1. Examine  the  scene  of  offence  and  satisfy  as  to  whether  the  place  is  a secluded one affording privacy for the accused to indulge in sex against her will at the time when the offence is alleged to have occurred. The scene of offence is photographed and video graphed to convince the court as to how the scene of offence is secluded one, affording privacy for the accused to indulge in the rapacious attack on the victim. 

**Identity of the Victim & Other Precautions** 

660\. Precautions should be taken to ensure that the identity of victim is not revealed in any publication.  Violations in this regard are liable for penal action u/s 228 A IPC. Do not subject the victim to too many embarrassing questions. Examine and record her statement in the presence of a female attendant. The victim should be asked to show the exact scene of offence. This should be done in such a way that she is least exposed to the public gaze. Collect the wearing apparel of the victim at the time of commission of offence under panchnama and send immediately for medical examination. Collect evidence regarding the prior illicit relation between the accused and  the  victim  if  any.  Protect  the  victim  and  her  parents  from  the  possible intimidation, threats, coercion and reprisals by the accused or their supporters. Also render the help that is possible to the victim in her rehabilitation. The determination of blood groups may prove to be of invaluable help in the detection of rape cases. The  DNA  finger  printing  provides  convincing  scientific  proof  in  cases  of  rape. Wherever  necessary  the  samples  should  be  sent  for  DNA  analysis  and  opinion should be taken in the manner prescribed in this regard. 

**Offences of Sexual Intercourse**  

661\. There are four types of sexual intercourse by a man with a woman, which are made offences though not amounting to rape under section 376-A.to 376-D. They are; 

1. a man having sexual intercourse with his own wife who is living separately  from  him  under  a  decree  of  separation  or  under  any custom or usage, without her consent; 
1. any public servant taking advantage of his official position induces or seduces any woman in his or in his subordinate's custody, to have sexual intercourse with him; 
1. any superintendent or manager of a jail, remand home or other place 

   of custody or a woman's or children's institution takes advantage of 

   his position induces or seduces any woman in his custody to have sexual intercourse with him; and 

4. any person on the management or staff of a hospital taking advantage of his position induces or seduces any woman in that hospital to have sexual intercourse with him. 

661\.1  All  the  above  "'four  types  of  sexual  intercourse  except  the  first  one  are cognizable  offences  but  no  arrest  shall  be  made  by  a  police  official  without  the orders of a court. 

662\. **Unnatural Sexual Offences** 

1) Unnatural offence, as defined in section 377 of the IPC, is carnal intercourse against  the  order  of  nature  with  a  man,  woman  or  animal.  Sodomy  is  anal intercourse between two males, or between a man and a woman. Mostly, young boys  are  victims  of  such  unnatural  carnal  connection.  These  offences  are common but are rarely brought to notice. There are also a few eunuchs who are fond of appearing in a woman's costume, and ostensibly, live by singing, but habitually indulge in sodomy as passive agents. 
1) A case under section 376/377 of the IPC can be charged on the basis of the evidence of the victim, if it is not of a doubtful nature. It is not unsafe to act on the  uncorroborated  testimony  of  the  victim  alone,  if  the  victims'  evidence  is found to be truthful. More so if the victim is a child whether male or female. Corroboration through circumstantial or other evidence would be of immense value as ultimately the guilt has to be established beyond doubt. For instance, stains of semen may constitute important circumstantial evidence in these cases. Evidence of the medical officer, who has examined the victim soon after the offence is committed, is important. The skilful and sympathetic questioning and ascertaining  of  details  from  victims  would  itself  provide  clues  for  further evidence and the Investigating Officer must therefore make painstaking efforts to collect the same. Apart from other circumstantial evidence, DNA Finger printing is the most reliable evidence, which the IO should utilize in cases where it is necessary  and  where  other  circumstantial  evidence  is  not  forth  coming. Trafficking in children and child prostitution is a reprehensible but flourishing activity  of  organized  criminal  gangs.  Investigation  of  such  cases  should comprehensively aim at the organization and individual members thereof so that Police can deal them with in the specific case or under other laws apart from enabling preventive action. 
1) The following are some of the points to be ascertained while investigating these 

cases: 

1. injuries to the body, such as scratches and bruises on face, neck and hands; 
1. stains of semen on person or clothing; 
1. presence of semen in the anus, particularly in young children; 
1. injuries to, or in the neighbourhood of anus; 
1. laceration of rectal mucus membrane, 
1. infection of venereal disease present in the accused, and 
1. presence of hair of the victim on the offender and vice versa. 
1. In  respect  of  child  victims  of  either  sex  the  procurer  or  persons  who arranged the transaction, the place of birth, parentage, sex and age of the child; recovery of money or valuables from persons who are benefited;, enquiries and evidence of parents and others at his/her native place as to the procurement etc. 
4) It is very important that the investigating officer should, in cases of rape and unnatural offences, send the victim and the accused to the medical officer for examination  as  early  as  possible.  Clothing  and  other  articles  with  semen  or blood stains in their possession must be seized, carefully packed and despatched to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for analysis and report. 

663\. **Dowry Deaths** 

9. Dowry deaths are defined in section 304-B IPC, It provides for cases of death under suspicious circumstances within 7 years of marriage due to cruelty and harassment of husband or his relations in matters connected with  dowry.  Section  306  IPC  deals  with  suicides  of  women  due  to harassment of the husband or the in-laws. Section 498-A IPC deals with cruelty and harassment to a woman by her husband or relations of the husband, which causes mental or physical harm to her. Sections 113-A and 113-B of Indian Evidence Act provide for a presumption to be raised against the accused in these cases, thereby shifting the onus of proof of innocence, to the accused from the prosecution. Section 174 (3) CrPC provides  for  inquest  by  Magistrate  in  cases  of  death  of  women  under suspicious circumstances within 7 years of her marriage. Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act defines the word 'Dowry'. These are some of the legal provisions, which should be thoroughly understood for investigation into the cases of dowry deaths. 
2. The main ingredients to be proved by the prosecution in a case under section 304-B are the death of a woman within 7 years of marriage and secondly  that  it  was  occasioned  by  cruelty  on  account  of  demand  for dowry. The cruelty is defined in explanations A & B of section 498 A. While both explanations apply to 498 A and 306 IPC, explanation B only applies to 304 B. The presumption available under section 113 A I.E. Act is applicable to cases of 498 A and 306 IPC where as the presumption under  113  B  I.E.  Act  is  applicable  to  304  B  IPC.  The  IO  should  be thorough with these important provisions of law for correct and legally sound investigation of cases u/s 498-A, 306 and 304-B IPC. 
2. If the complaint discloses a dowry death it should be registered under section 304-B and 498-A IPC may be added. Where it is a suicide due to cruelty or harassment, a case under section 498 A and 306 IPC should be registered. The inquest of the dead body should be held in these cases, only  by  an  executive  magistrate  according  to  174(3)  CrPC.  Prompt intimation should be sent to the concerned Executive Magistrate to visit the  scene  and  hold  the  inquest.  The  police  should  associate  with  the inquest/enquiry conducted by the executive magistrate. As soon as the inquest  is  completed  the  body  should  be  sent  for  postmortem examination. The procedure for inquests and postmortem examinations would be the same as for any case of murder. The Government has issued instructions  as  to  the  manner  of  conducting  inquest  by  executive Magistrates in the States on different occasions. 
2. The investigating Officer should visit the scene of occurrence promptly, inspect it, collect all relevant material and evidence, record the statements of witnesses and take all necessary steps regarding the processing of the scene of offence for processing of crime scene. The IO should particularly look  for  evidence  in  the  form  of  letters  and  other  communications  or documents and all other material, which show evidence of harassment and cruelty.  He  should  also  collect  evidence  relating  to  the  receipt  or agreement regarding  the  dowry.  Evidence  in proof of  marriage should also be collected. 
5. While  examining  the  relatives  of  the  victim  care  should  be  taken  to inspire confidence in them to disclose all details and evidence of cruelty or harassment and details concerning dowry. Some times the bereaved parents overwhelmed by emotions may also make wild allegations. 
5. Independent evidence has to be collected by examining the neighbours of the area particularly near the victim's residence and other persons known to the deceased. It may not be entirely safe to rely only on the evidence of the close kith and kin of the victim, particularly in the absence of some other circumstances. In such cases the friends and other acquaintances than to the parents will know instances of harassment more. It is also possible that the victim might not have disclosed all the instances to her parents. 
5. The offences are non-bailable and non-compoundable. The arrests of the accused should be made as soon as the initial investigation is completed and  culpability  is  established.  If  there  is  any  risk  of  the  accused absconding, action should be taken to keep them under surveillance if necessary  till  the  initial  investigation  is  completed.  The  initial investigation  means  inquest  and  postmortem  and  examination  of important witnesses. When the prima facie case is established against any accused, there should be no delay in arrest. 

VIII.  The evidence of cruelty is the vital factor in the cases of dowry deaths. Closest examination of independent witnesses apart from the relatives, 

letters  indicating  the  state  of  relationship  between  the  victim  and  her husband,  the  transfer  of  money  through  banks  to  the  husband  or  his relatives and their accounts, the purchases and assets acquired after the marriage and their source would be necessary to establish not only the transactions  relating  to  dowry  but  also  the  cruelty  exhibited  by  the 

husband and his relatives. 

IX.  In  investigation  of  dowry  deaths  by  burning,  the  remnants  and  all 

evidence 

relating to the burning of the victim should be carefully collected.  The investigation  should  be  conducted  on  a  day-to-day  basis  without  any delay and completed promptly. During the trial it is necessary that the witnesses are produced and their evidence recorded in the court as early as possible. 

664\. **Matrimonial Cruelty and Harassment**  

1) Cruelty is defined in section 498 - A IPC. Cruelty means; 
   1. any willful conduct which is of such a nature as likely to drive the woman to commit  suicide  or  to  cause  grave  injury  or  danger  to  life,  limb  or  health (whether mental or physical) of the woman; or 
   1. harassment of the woman to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand. 
   1. Cruelty may be either by the husband or the relative of husband of the woman subjected to such cruelty. 
   1. The stipulation of 'within 7 years of marriage' is applicable to section 304 - B and not to 498-A and 306 IPC. 
1) Section 113A of Evidence Act raises presumption against her husband and his relatives of abetment of suicide by a married woman. If there is cruelty as defined in  this  section  prior  to  the  woman  committing  suicide  within  seven  years  of marriage is established, the presumption is raised against her husband and other accused. 
1) In the investigation of cases of this nature the 1O should pay attention to the following points. 
1. The  complaint  from  the  affected  woman  or  her  parents  or  brothers  or recognised women forum or sisters should be registered promptly. 
2. The prosecution should establish  that she is  a  married  woman,  that she is subjected to cruelty and that it was by her husband or his relatives. 
2. The evidence collected particularly the letters, notes, diaries, bank accounts and other material objects should be examined and properly appreciated. All witnesses who are likely to testify to the acts of harassment or cruelty should be promptly examined. 
2. The husband and his relatives should be examined. 
2. The orders governing the arrest and search etc. contained in the Chapter 25 should be scrupulously followed. 
2. Where there are injuries, the procedure prescribed for medical examination and certificate should be complied. 
2. Very often allegation of persistent demands for money or property is made. Normally oral assertions are made and the IO should skillfully, by examining as  many  witnesses  as  possible  ascertain  the  correct  situation.  Such circumstances as the woman being sent away or going away to her parents' place, her disclosures to relatives and friends would be useful evidence. 
2. The  cases  under  this  section  are  cognizable,  non-bailable  and  of  warrant procedure tribal by a First Class Magistrate and also non-compoundable. 
2. Where  reconciliation  takes  place  between  wife  and  husband  and  the application is made, the High Court u/s 482 CrPC, in exceptional cases, may permit  them  to  compound.  But  the  wife  is  not  permitted  to  withdraw  the charge sheet filed by police. 

665\. **Immoral Traffic in Women** 

1) The trafficking in women and abuse of children is a very heinous crime. The prevention of Immoral Traffic Act (PITA), 1956 as modified in 1988 contain various new provisions to effectively deal with the menace of this problem. The very definition of prostitution has been altered and the status of the prostitute more as a victim has been recognised in the modified Act. This Act is more of a human rights legislation intended to protect the interest of the weaker sections such as women and children from abuse. Stringent penal provisions are provided to deal with the exploiters of these people. The modus operandi adopted by the offenders generally consists of tempting young girls from the villages and towns, promising  affluent  life,  glamour  of  cities,  career  in  cinema  and  subsequently landing them in brothel houses. The victims include poor and illiterate persons, those who have domestic and marital problems, widows etc. The other M.O. is recruiting girls on grounds of marriage with rich persons abroad and ultimately their being exploited sexually and used as domestic servants after the formality of a marriage or otherwise. Procuring minor girls and boys has also become serious form of crime. The following instructions should be observed in the investigation of such cases. Wrongful confinement, kidnapping and abduction are some times the accompanying offences along with the offences under PITA. 
2) In PITA, prostitution is defined as sexual exploitation or abuse of persons for commercial purposes. As per this definition, the prostitution is not confined to only  women.  Homosexuality  is  also  brought  under  this  definition.  Further  it includes not only exploitation of one person by another but also abuse of one's own self for commercial purposes. Exploitation or abuse for purposes other than commercial is not covered under this definition. 
2) Brothel is defined as a place where sexual exploitation for abuse is carried on for the gain of another person or for the mutual gain of two or more prostitutes. Prostitution  is  not  an  offence  by  itself.  Section  3  to  9  contains  the  penal provisions in the Act. In the offences covered by sections 3 to 6 and 9 of PITA, prostitute is a victim and not an accused where as in the offences covered by section  7  and  8,  prostitute  is  an  accused.  The  IO  should  appreciate  these provisions  of  law  clearly  in  order  to  ensure  correct  investigation  of  cases. Running a brothel or letting premises to a brothel is offence under section 3. Living on the earnings of the prostitute being above the age of 18 years is an offence under section 4. Even husband or adult children can also be accused under this section. Procuring or inducing or taking any person for the sake of prostitution  whether  the  victim  accompanies  willingly  or  unwillingly  is  an offence under section 5. 
2) Detaining a person in premises where prostitution is carried on is an offence under section 6. Certain important presumptions are provided in this section for the benefit of prosecution in proving the cases under this section. It shall be presumed that she is detained in place of prostitution if; 
1. a child of the victim is found in a brothel; or 
1. a   minor victim is medically examined and found with   sexually transmitted diseases; or 
1. The jewellery of a victim is in the custody of the management of the brothel. 
5) Prostitution in the vicinity of a public place is an offence against the prostitute under section 7. A public place is one that is accessible to the public in general. Seducing or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution from any public place or within the site of or to the hearing of any person in any public place, whether from within a building or house, by means of words, gestures or any exposures is an offence under section 8. Seduction of any person when in custody or charge or care of any person in authority is an offence under section 9. The special police  officers  not  below  the  rank  of  inspectors  appointed  by  the  State Government under this Act are only competent to investigate the offences under this Act falling in their jurisdiction. 
5) Searches, for rescue of persons from brothels or to detect offences under this Act, can be carried out only by special police officers without warrant, in the presence of two independent witnesses and one among them shall be woman. Any other officer not below the rank of a Sub-inspector can also- conduct a search  for  rescue  of  persons  only  under  the  warrant  from  a  competent magistrate. Arrest without warrant may be made by a special police officer or under his direction or subject to his prior approval; a police officer not below the rank of an S.I. may arrest the accused and immediately report to the special police officer. 
5) When an offender was prosecuted and convicted for an offence under this Act and again convicted for the second time within a period of 5 years, the IO can file a memo at the time of passing the sentence to the Court requesting the court to notify the address of the convict. At the time of conviction of female offenders found guilty for the offences under section 7 and 8, a trial court may, instead of sentencing them to imprisonment, send them to corrective homes taking in to consideration the character, state of health and mental condition of the offender and other circumstances. The victims of offences under sections 3, 

4, 5, 6 and 9 may also make an application to the concerned magistrate for sending them to protective home or a correctional institution. If the magistrate is satisfied, he may make such an order to send them to such places. 

(VIII) The area executive magistrate, on information from the police or otherwise 

that prostitution is being carried on in a house or brothel within 200 meters of any public place as defined in section 7 (1) of the Act, may issue notice to the owner, lessee or occupier of the place to show cause within 7 days as to why that place shall not be attached for improper use and after making due enquiry and after giving opportunity to be heard, may pass an order; A) Directing the eviction of the occupier within 7 days from the date of order and B) also directing the owner to obtain previous approval of the magistrate if the owner wants to let out the premises within one year from the date of order. Similarly a prostitute may also be evicted under section 20. 

(IX) The IO should keep in mind the following guidelines in the investigation of 

cases under this Act. 

1. The rescued women should be examined in great detail, with sympathy and not with derision and hostility. The grip of the procurers would be so strong and possibility of their acceptance in society or family being bleak, they tend not to disclose any details. Hence the IO should first take all steps in coordination with the Advisory Bodies, voluntary Social Welfare Organisations in the field, the Governmental agencies in charge of correctional and Protection homes to give confidence to the women to be able to tell the details of persons who exploited them. 
1. The law is intended to punish those who exploit the women and trade on them and not the victims. The evidence of victims is therefore extremely important. 
1. The names and identity of women is often changed, and hence, the correct identity  should  be  established  by  gathering  information  about  their  native village/town. 
1. The persons doing odd jobs in the brothel or place where the women are kept and used as sex workers would be a useful corroboration. 
   5. The chits, papers or bank transactions if any, house owner's title, the rental documents true or false, municipal records, details of previous cases in which the accused may be involved should be collected. 
   5. The  means  of  livelihood  of  the  accused  should  be  thoroughly  investigated including the adequacy or otherwise of such means to the style of life being led by him. 
7. The circumstances under which the girl has disappeared or left should be brought out clearly. 
7. Medical examination of persons found whether women or minors, male or female should be got conducted. 
7. Where offences under this Act or the Indian Penal Code are part of organised crime, 120B I PC should be added. 
7. Photographic or video graphic evidence whenever possible should be secured during investigation of the cases. The IO should take special care to produce the witnesses and in consultation with the APP/PP ensure the posting of case on a day-to-day basis. It should be remembered that a sense of shame, reluctance and even  fear  very  often  prevents  the  witnesses  from  deposing  either  during investigation or trial. Necessary precautions should be taken to prevent undue publicity. For necessary publicity, permission of the concerned court should be taken.

**Chapter **521**** 

**Drug Trafficking** 

**Introduction** 

666\. Narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances are essential for human being and animals. These are used as basic components in the manufacture of various types of medicines.  Different  types  of  medicines  whether  sedatives,  amphetamines  or hallucinogens have some form of narcotics or psychotropic substances as their basic component.  Narcotic  drugs  and  psychotropic  substances,  thus,  are  used  for  the diagnosis, cure and treatment of various diseases and their prevention in man and animals  both.  However,  the  unscrupulous  and  criminals  misuse  and  abuse  of  the narcotics and psychotropic substances have created varied health hazards and health problems, and have also triggered off a chain of activities leading to misuse, abuse and smuggling of these substances locally, nationally and internationally. Police as a chief of law enforcement agency are expected to play an effective and efficient role in the area of prevention and detection of misuse, abuse and trafficking of the drugs.  

**The NDPS Act, Other Acts & Efforts** 

667\. The offences under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act 1985 are heinous in nature and directly or indirectly amount to poisoning large number of people to ultimate death. This crime is a serious threat to the life of the victims and poses a danger to society at large. The Police all over the world are fighting this crime. The NDPS Act has replaced the Opium Act and the Dangerous Drugs  Act.  The  Act  has  provided  for  deterrent  punishment  by  providing  for imprisonment up to 20 years and fine up to Rs. 2 lakhs. Several departments are empowered to deal with these cases including the police. The offences under this Act are cognizable and non-bailable. 

521

668\. **Powers, Procedures and the Authorities** 

1. All first class Magistrates and all Gazetted officers of departments empowered to deal with these cases are competent to search any suspected premises either by themselves  or  issue  warrants  to  persons  above  the  rank  of  an  attender  or  a constable for search. 
1. In cases of emergency, the persons who are entitled to search by virtue of warrant issued by those Gazetted officers are competent to search even without a warrant but  should  report  searches  and  seizure  if  any  immediately  to  such  officers competent to issue warrants. 
1. But for the special procedure for investigation provided in the Act, the police have to adopt the same procedure as laid down in Chapter 12 of CrPC. 
1. There are two different procedures for searches and seizures. While the search of premises is to be carried out as laid down above, different procedure is prescribed for search of persons, When a person is to be searched, he must be informed in writing whether he would like to be searched by the police officer conducting the search or in the presence of a Gazetted officer or a Magistrate (section 50). If he opts for taking him to a Gazetted officer or a Magistrate, the person conducting the search can detain him till such time. 
1. Any Gazetted officer or any person entrusted with the warrant by a Gazetted officer  or  when  such  person  in  case  of  emergency  conducts  search  without warrants, if the above persons are not SHOs, they shall forward the arrested person  and  the  material  seized  without  un-necessary  delay  to  the  officer  in charge of the nearest police station (section 52) and the officer in charge shall take charge of and keep in safe custody such articles pending the orders of a magistrate (section 55). The arrested person shall be re-arrested and forwarded to the nearest magistrate for remand (section 43 CrPC). 
1. The failure on the part of the officer in charge of the police station to follow the above procedure (order 680-1-5) or refusal to lake charge of such person or material will render him liable for punishment up to one year or fine or both (section 59 NDPS Act) 

523

669\. **Other Important Provisions** 

1. Sections 15 to 32 of the NDPS Act lay down the punishments for various offences. Most offences except possession of small quantity for personal consumption are punishable with minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment. Section 27, which deal with possession of small  quantity  for  personal  consumption  has  lesser  punishment.  The thrust of the Act is on trafficking, which include cultivation, manufacture, transport, export and import of the drugs and their distribution. The Act also provides for forfeiture of property derived from, used in illicit traffic in narcotics for which detailed procedure has been laid down in sections 68-A  to  68-Y.  Section  52-A  permits  disposal  of  seized  property  after taking an inventor/ and photographs which can be accepted as evidence as they are certified by the concerned Magistrate. 
1. The most important point to be proved in all cases of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is possession of the drug. Any omission or non- compliance with the legal requirements laid down in the search or seizure will vitiate the proceedings and may result in acquittal of the accused. Whether it is transport, distribution or cultivation or manufacture, it is the possession of the drug that has to be proved by the prosecution. Even preparation, attempt, abetment and conspiracy relating to these drugs are also  punishable.  The  Act  also  provides  for  enhanced  punishments  for subsequent offences. 

**Guidelines of the Narcotics Control Bureau** 

670\. Some of the mandatory provisions and points to be remembered are indicated below:

1. A gist of information received should be incorporated in the Police Station records and the same should be intimated to the immediate  superior  officer  and  also  entered  in  the  Station House general diary. The accused should be informed about the grounds of his arrest as in all other cases of arrest (section 52 CrPC). Report of arrest and seizure should be forwarded to the  immediate  superior  officer  within  48  hours  under acknowledgement.  All  these  records  are  required  to  be produced in court before trial. 
2. Since  the  prosecution  has  to  prove  possession  of  the  drugs beyond  doubt  before  any  presumption  can  be  raised,  it  is necessary to follow the guidelines given below in the matter relating to raid or search by the Police Officers.
2. All  officers  deployed  for  search  should  carry  their  Identity Card. 
2. There should be a prior planning including survey of the place where the search has to be undertaken. The officer-in-charge of the search should deploy his officers in such a manner that all the entrances/exits are properly guarded.

9. The statements of the persons concerned should be recorded on the  date  of  search  itself  lest  the  party  tutor  them.  For  this purpose,  a  brief  and  immediate  scrutiny  of  the 

   records/documents should be done. 

11. Soon  after  the  commencement  of  the  search  the  contact telephone number of the party should be given to the officer who is monitoring the search/raid. He should be apprised of the commencement of the search and its progress from time to time and the important  material that has come to notice till then. Before withdrawal from the search, as far as possible, clearance  from  the  same  officer  should  be  taken  unless  the search party has already briefed him in this regard. 
11. All  papers  including  search  warrant  (executed)  and  the Panchnama,  the  initial  intelligence  and  other  papers  given before proceeding on search should be returned to the person who issued the warrant.

**Procedure with Regard to Samples** 

672\.  Procedure  of  drawal,  storage,  testing  and  disposal  of  samples  from  seized narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. 

1. All  illicit  narcotic  drugs  or  psychotropic  substances  recovered  from  a person, place, conveyance etc. are liable to confiscation (sections 60 to 63 NDPS  Act).  Further,  they  constitute  important  evidence  for  any  act, omission or commission on the part of a person rendering him liable for punishment  under  Chapter  IV  of  the  NDPS  Act,  1985.  Most  of  the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances cannot be conclusively proved to be such drug or substance merely by visual examination in the trial Court and hence the drugs seized should be sent for chemical examination to FSL The disposal of the confiscated goods should be as per the orders of the court. 
1. If the drugs seized are found in packages/containers the same should be serially numbered for  purposes of identification.  In case the  drugs  are found in loose form the same should be arranged to be packed in unit container of uniform size and serial numbers should be assigned to each package/container. Besides the serial number, the gross and net weight, particulars  of  the  drug  and  the  date  of  seizure  should  invariably  be indicated on the packages. In case sufficient space is not available for recording  the  above  information on  the  package,  a Card  Board Label, should be affixed with the seal of the seizing officer and the above details should be recorded. 
1. Samples from the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances seized must be drawn at the place of recovery, in duplicate, in the presence of search (Panch)  witnesses  and  the  person  from  whose  possession  the  drug  is recovered and a mention to this effect shall invariably be made in the Panchanama drawn on the spot. 
1. The quantity to be drawn in each sample for chemical test should be 5 grams in respect of all narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances except in the cases of Opium, Ganja and Charas/Hashish where a quantity of 24 grains  in  each  case  is  required  for  chemical  test.  The  same  quantities should be taken for the duplicate sample also. The seized drugs in the package/containers should be mixed well to make it homogeneous and representative before the sample in duplicate is drawn. 
5. In the case of seizure of a single package/container one sample in duplicate is to be drawn. It is advisable to draw one sample in duplicate from each package/container in case of seizure of more than one package/container. 
5. However, when the package/containers seized together are of identical size and weight, bearing identical markings and the contents of each package give identical results on colour test by UN kit, conclusively indicating that the packages are identical in all respects, the packages/container may be carefully bunched in lots of 10 packages/containers. In case of seizure of Ganja and Hashish, the packages/containers may be bunched in lots of 

   40. For each lot of packages/containers, one sample in duplicate may be drawn. 
5. After making such lots, in the case of Hashish and Ganja, if less than 20 packages/containers  remain,  and  in  case  of  other  drugs  less  than  5 packages/containers  remain,  no  bunching  would  be  necessary  and  no samples need be drawn. 
5. If it is 5 or more in case of other drugs and substances and 20 or more in case of Ganja and Hashish, one more sample in duplicate may be drawn for such remaining package/containers. 
5. While drawing one sample in duplicate from a particular lot, it must be ensured  that  representative  drug  in  equal  quantity  is  taken  from  each package/container of that lot and mixed together to make a composite whole from which the samples are drawn for that lot. 

**Numbering of Packages/Containers** 

673\. Subject to the detailed procedure of identification of packages/ containers, as indicated, each package/container should be securely sealed and an identification slip pasted/attached on each one of them at such place and in such manner as will avoid easy obliteration of the marks and numbers on the slip. Where more than one sample is drawn, each sample should also be serially numbered and marked as S-1, S-2, S-3 and so on, on both the samples. It should carry the serial number of the packages and marked as P-1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. All samples must be drawn and sealed in the presence of the accused, search witnesses and seizing officer and all of them shall be required  to  put  their  signatures  on  each  sample.  The  official  seal  of  the  seizing officer should also be affixed. If the person, from whose custody the drugs have been recovered, wants to put his own seal on the sample, the same may be allowed on both the samples.

674\. **Packaging and Sealing of Samples** 

1. The sample in duplicate should be kept in neat sealed plastic bags, as it is convenient and safe. The plastic bag container should be kept in paper envelope, properly marked as original or duplicate. Both the envelopes should also bear the S.No. of the package(s) container(s) from which the sample has been drawn. The duplicate envelope containing the sample will also have a reference of the test memo. The seals should be legible. This envelope along with test memos should be kept in another envelope, which  should  also  be  sealed  and  marked  "Secret-Drug  Sample/Test memo" to be sent to the FSL.
1. All drugs should be properly classified, carefully weighed and samples drawn on the spot of seizure. After sampling, detailed inventory of such packages/containers  should  be  prepared  for  being  enclosed  to  the Panchanama, Original wrappers must also be preserved for evidentiary purposes.
1. After completion of Panchanama, the drugs should  be packed, in heat sealed plastic bags. For bulk quantities of ganja, instead of plastic bags, gunny  bags  may  be  utilized. Agencies  of  the  Central  and  State Government, who are vested with the powers of investigation under the law, specifically designate their godowns for storage purposes.
1. All  drugs must  invariably  be stored  in  safes and  vaults  provided  with double-locking  system.  Such  godowns,  as  a  matter  of  rule,  be  placed 

   under  the  overall  supervision  and  charge  of  a  Gazetted  Officer  of  the respective  enforcement  agency,  who  should  exercise  utmost  care, circumspection and personal supervision, as far as possible. Such officers should not be below the rank of Superintendent in the Departments of Customs, Central Excise, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Narcotics Control Bureau, CBI, BSF, and station house officer/officer in charge of a Police Station. Superintendent of State Excise, MRO, Drug Inspector of Drug Control Department, etc. in the states and enforcement agencies in Union Territories. They will personally be held accountable for safety and security of the drugs. Each seizing officer should deposit the drugs fully packed and sealed with his seal in the godown within 48 hours of seizure of  such  drugs,  with  a  forwarding  memo  indicating  Crime  Number, name(s)  of  accused,  test  memo  reference,  description  of  drugs  in  the sealed packages/containers and other goods, if any, drug-wise quantity in each  package/container,  drug-wise  number  of  packages/containers  and total number of all packages/containers.

5. It  will  be  incumbent  upon  the  Inspecting  Officers  of  the  various departments  mentioned  to  make  visit  to  the  godowns  for  ensuring adequate security and safety and for taking measures for timely disposal of  drugs.  The  Inspecting  Officers  should  record  their remarks/observations.
5. The Heads of respective enforcement agencies (both Central and State Governments) may prescribe such periodical reports and returns, as they may deem fit, to monitor the safe receipt, deposit, storage, accounting and disposal of seized drugs. Since the early disposal of drugs assumes utmost importance, the enforcement agencies should obtain orders for pre-trial disposal of drugs and other articles
